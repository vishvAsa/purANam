## परिचयः
### Preface
This work called the Madhura-vijaya or the Virakan parayacharita was written by a female author called Gangadevi, as is evident from the colophon, lgfa frizioa विरचिते मधुराविजयनाम्नि वीरकम्परायचारते" occurring at the end of the first and the second sargas. It is further clear from verses 39-41 of the seventh sarga that the authoress was a queen of the prince Kampana, the hero of the work, who ruled at Conjeevaram absat 1367 A. D.

It is interesting to ante that Sanskrit Literature claims to number of authors from among the fair sex. In Vedic times there were such highly cultured ladies as Gargi Vachaknavi, Badava Pralitheyi and ot bers, who were seers of Vedic hymns, and whom Asvalayana mentions along with Sumanta, Vaigarapayana and other venerable Rishis of old. Rajasekhara, the dramatist who is said to have flourished about 950 A. D., has immortalized in his verses the names of a few poetesses* whose capacity judged from the merit of their verses foucd in the extant anthologies, must have been of a high order. In his Kavyamimamsa, a work on poetics, Rajasekbera cites as authority the views of his gifted wife Avantisundarı, and also observest that women too, like med, may become poets, as the inner genius and not the sex is the determining factor, and that there were highly accomplished daughters of kings and ministers who were not only well versed in Sastras but were also blessed with the poetic gift. 

Later than our authoress, there fourished in the Court of Achyutadevaraya at Vijayanagara in the early part of the 16th century A, D, a lady author by the name of Tirumalambika, 1 who is said to have written a Champukavya called the Varadambikaparinaya commemorating the marriage of Achyuta devaraya and Varadambika. The poetess Ramabhadramba bas a ritten a beautiful kavya known as the Raghunathabhyudaya in honor of Raghupatha-Nayaka of Tanjore, a great patron of learning and an author of many Sanskrit works, who ruled over Tanjore in the early part of the 17th century A. D. In the court of this king had also flourished the illustrious poetess Madhuravani, who is known to have composed nany Sanskrit poems and written & mahakavya rendering the Andhra Ramayana of her patron into Sanskrit. From this work we further learn that there were several other ladies along with her who were eminent in poetry and other fine arts. * We can thus see that there have been several female poets shining now and then, in the realm of Sanskrit Literature; but we have been able till now to come across only a very few of their works.


+ This we learnt from Mr, T, S, Kuppusvari Sastriac of Tanjore, Compare algo No. y of the Madras Epigraphical collection for 1904.- Epig, Annl, Rept, for 1904. p 36.

We find mention of the following names of authoresses in Sanskrit literatur e yiz,, Indulekha, Kuntidevi, Gaurika, Prakasa-datta, Phalguhastini, Muktapida, Marngna ala, Maurika, Prabbudevi and others. 

Among the productions of the post-Vedic poetesses known to us at present, the Madhuravijaya appears to be the earliest. the historical value of this work is ably discussed in the introduction to this work; and we shall write here a few words regarding its poetical merit. The authoress instead of drawing the subject matter from the well-known Itihasas, as is usual with the generality of Sanskrit poete, has chosen the biography of her royal consort as a fit theme to exhibit her remarkable poetical talents. The work is in the form of classical kavya conforming to the rules laid down in the treatises on poetics and contains the usual lengthy description of the seasons, the twilight, the rising of the moon and other necessary topics. The authoress writes in the Vaidarbhi style and her thoughts which iow with ease and simplicity are clothed in diction at once beautiful and charming. Her similes are grand and drawn direct from nature, with none of the conventional pedantry of grammar or rhetoric, which so largely spoils the productions of later day poets.

In paying a tribute to Kalidasa, the authoress observes,"दासतां कालिदासस्य कवयः के न बिभ्रति। इदानीमपि तस्यार्यानुपजीवन्त्यमी यतः ॥" and appears to include herself among those who tread the path of that master-poet. She has adopted certain scenes and descriptions which are favourite with Kalidasa, but they are transformed at the mint of her imagination, and lovested with a new significance. We shall quote two verses in support of the above statement. Kalidasa describe the pregnancy of a lady in the Raghuvamsa, thus:--

> "शरीरसादादसमग्रभूषणा मुखेन सालक्ष्यत लोध्रपाण्डुना  
> तनुप्रकाशेन विचेयतारका प्रभातकल्पा शशिनेव शर्वरी ॥" (III, 2.)

and the march of a king with his army thur :

> "स सेनां महती कर्षन् पूर्वसागरगामिनीम् ।  
बभौ हरजटाभ्रष्टां गङ्गामिव भगीरथः" (IV, 52.)

Our authoress describes the same subject in a similar figure in the versess

> मुखेन तन्वी शरपाण्डरेण विमुक्तरत्नाभरणा विरेजे।  
विलूनराजीववना दिनान्ते छायाशशाङ्केन शरन्नदीव ॥ (II, 2.) 

> "स नयन् महतीं सेनां व्यरुचद् वीरकुञ्जरः।  
पयोदमालाम् आकर्षन् पौरस्त्य+++(=पुरस्स्थ)+++ इव मारुतः ॥" (IV. 35.) 

but has however invested hor ideas with a new beauty that they appeal to our imagination with as much fresbaess as if they were her own.

The edition of this work is based on a single palm leaf manuscript belonging to Pandit Mr. N. Ramasyami Sastriar, Head Pandit, Office of the Curator for the publication of Sanskrit works, Trivandrum. It was found in an extremely worn out manuscript yolume, combined with the disarranged leaves of portions of the Siddharthacharita or Padyachudamani and a nataka of unknown name. It is written in grantha characters, and is not free from errors. The Maduravejaya begins on the 10th leaf and closes abruptly on the 169th leaf. It is not possible to infer how many more leaves of the manuscript have been lost. A few leaves are also missing in the middle of the manuscript and most of the remaining ones are bored with holes by insects. The first five sargas of the manuscript are, to some extent, continuous bad the remaining portions are fragmentary. As it stands at present, the manuscript contains the history of Kampana up to the defeat of the Muhammadans at Madura ; but if the title Madhura vijaya be significant, it cannot be far from right to infer that the work did not contain more than a sarga at the end. The letters or words that we have inserted in the place of those that have been lost are marked with asterisks and enclosed within brackets.

### SECOND EDITION.
The work was first brought out as a pure labour of love and little bad I thought that there would be any necessity for the work to go through the press again. However, with the favourable reception it has received at the hands of the Sanskritists and on account of its having been prescribed by the University of Madras as text-book for the B. A. Degree Examination-Group VI, the few hundred copies of the first edition have now been sold out, and I have been urged by friends to issue a second edition.

Mr. R. Sewell, the author of "A Long Forgotten Emapire thinks that Kampana starting with a large army from his capital could not bave reached Mulvay (Kantakanana-pattana) in five or six days' march as stated in the work (vide, page 21 aloka 47) and that this apparently incorrect statement detracts from the historical accuracy of the work. As the distance between the Vijayanagara capital and Bulvay (N. Arcot) is likely to be only about 150 miles, it is not impossible that the army intent on a sudden manoeuvre which was calculated to take Sumbuvaraya by arrprise could have, by forced marches at the rate of 30 miles a day, covered the distance in five or six days, and that there may not have been any necessity for the kavya to exaggerate its hero's achievemment at the cost of historical veracity.

Some Pandits are loath to admit that such fine com position is the Kamparayacharita could bave been the production of a woman, and they would have us believe that it way have been the work of court-poets, which had been mothered on the queen Gangadevi. This scepticism on the part of Pandits which implies an unwarranted denial of postic genius in women way well be convincingly answered by what has already been said above, that Sanskrit Literature can boast of quite a fair percentage of women as distinguished votaries of the poetic muse.

That this work was popalar among the literati is evident from the fact that it appears to have served as a model for the Raghavendravijaya, a kavya composed by Narayana Kavi in honor of the Madhvacharya, Raghavendra Syamin, the pontifical head of the Sumatindra-math in the 17th century A. D. ; for the tell-tale similarity in several ideas and expressions in both the poems could not have been the result of mere chance. A few parallels are cited below for purposes of comparison :

It is much to be regretted that it has not been possible to secure a complete manuscript of the work, and consequently this edition differs very little from the former except that a few textual corrections, the result of further study and careful revisions have been inserted.

Pandit Mr. V. Srinivasa Sestri who had participated in the pleasure of bringing out the first edition of this small work and who would, with his untiring patience, perhaps have succeeded in procuring a more perfect manuscript is now no more, and in his untimely death Sanskrit research bas lost a persevering and conscientious worker. My best thanks are due to Pandit Mr. R. Harihara Sastriar, Head Panditi. Sanskrit Publication Department, Trivandrum, who read the $ext in proof and gave me a few welcome suggestions,

### Introduction

ONE of the most interesting manuscripts that have been discovered in recent times is the Kamparaya-charita of Gangadevi. It is interesting in more ways than one-firstly, be cause it is a work of great historical importance, dealing as it does with a period of which little or nothing is satisfactorily known; secondly, because of the gifted authorese, Gangadevi, who was herself one of the queens of the prince Kampana, the hero; and lastly, because of the sonorous language and beauty of the poem. But, unfortunately no more than a single copy of it has hitherto been forthcoming, and that too a very much damaged one. There are here and there large blanks left out by the scribe in the copy available to us, a fact evidencing the broken state of even the original from which the copy was made; but even the portions that have been brought to light now, are full of interesting information regarding the conquest of Madura by Kampana. We shall discuss the merits of the work, its autboreas and the history contained in it after we have given an abstract of its contents.

The existence of this remarkable manuscript was first brought to my notice by my friend Pandit G. Harihara Sastr of Trivandrum; and from the abstract of contents of the karya supplied to me by Pandit V. Srinivasa Sastri I am enabled to give below an account of the poem Madhuravijaya.

#### CONTENTS OF THE POEM

The story begins with Bukka raja, the brother of Hari hard, who was reigning at Vijayanagara situated on the bank of the river Tungabhadra. His vassals and generals were respectful, loving and loyal to him, and his enemies' armies were always in a disturbed state of mind on account of his ever-growing prowess. The water that flowed from his hands in making gifts was able to revive the tree called dharma which had withered away owing to the increase of sins in this Kali age. He had plenty of elephants, horses and other divisions of the army; and all the kings and chiefs living in the regions bounded by the Vindhya mountains on the north, by the Malaya mountains on the south, by the Udayachala on the East and by the Astacala on the west owed him allegiance. In his capital, there were gopuras as tall as the peake of Meru, beautiful pleasure gardens with hillocks and actificial baths, The river Tungabhadra served as a moat to the city of Vijaya-nagára, which was also surrounded by loity fortified walls all round. In Pampa (Hampe), a suburb of this city, there was the temple of Virupaksha. The rule of Bukkaraya was so peaceful and so productive of good to the people that the citizens began to entertain doubts if Manu himself had not incarnated in the person of Bakkaraya, Though his mind paid regard equally to dharma, artha and kama, he had still a partiality for the first purushartha. He had several wives, but he loved Devayi more than the others. Enjoying thus all the various pleasures of life, king Bukkaraya was ruling the earth.

Devayi, the queen of the king of Kuntala, gave birth first to a princa named Kampana; and after him were born Kampana (?) and Sangama. These three sons of Bukka by Davayi resembled in their lustre the three eyes of Siva. While pregnant with the elder Kampana, the queen-mother Devayi had desired a sacred plunge in the holy waters of the Tamraparni. (The author by mentioning this fact implies that the desire of the mother to bathe in the Tamraparni so affected the unborn child that when the child grew up to manhood, bis inclination was to extend his conquests as far south as the Tamraparni and reach its bank.) When the prince was born, be was named Kampana because he made his enemies quake with fear at the very mention of his name. 

The youthful Kampana (wherevar this name occurs in subsequent portions, it is used to denote only the elder of the two sons of Bukka, who are said to have borne the same name) was well-versed in all the kalas (branches of learning) and was equally well-trained in the use of arms. While Kampana was yet young, his father Bukka summoned him to his presence, discoursed to him on the evils that befall young princes by their indulgence in women, gambling, hunting, drinking spirituous liquors, and so on, and strongly advised him to avoid even the thought of them from entering bis mind. He then pointed out to his son the necessity of conducting himself so well that even the fickle Lakshmi should become pleased to abide with him for ever. Finally, he told the prince that a large number of the powerful generals (samanta-rajas), of the kingdom would, through his own influence, show subordination and good will to him (Kampana) and be ever ready to serve him faithfully. Well furnished as be was with elephants, horse and men, his father directed him to give full scope to his prowess and also showed him the direction in which the prince could exhibit his own vast skill in arms, the power of his army and the loyalty of his generals. The Dravida chief, named Champaraya, ruling over the Tundira-mandala (the Tondaim mandala) was first recommended to receive the warlike attention of the ambitious prince and after subduing that chief, Kampana was to make Kanchipura his head-quarters, till a propitious time should come, when he could be able to attack and conquer the Vanyarajas further south and the Turushkarajas reigning at Madhura. The prince Kampana very much appreciated the valuable advice given him by his father and, resolving at once to carry it out faithfully, he declared his intention to all the generals under him and ordered them to make themselves ready to start out the very next day. He then embarked on his expedition for the conquest of the south,

When the 21xt day dawned, Kampana, baving attended to the usual ablutions of the morning, directed the commander of his forces to march the armies towards the south. No sooner was the order given than the battle drums began to resound everywhere. Thousands of elephants with carpets on their backs, horses fully caparisoned and men protected in their mailed coats, gathered together. The infantry consisted of men of various countries and carried the different weapons named the kripana, the karpana, the prasa, the kunta, and the kodanda ; the general of the army, men of high birth and rank, adorned with all such ornaments as are worn on the occasion of going out for the conquest of enemies, gathered in the gateway of the palace, awaiting the arrival of Prince Kampana. Flags were unfurled and umbrellas made of white silk were held up just before the prince came out. Tho brahmans recited the Atharvana-mantrą and blessed him to become victorious. The cry of " jaya" rang out everywhere. Kampana approached the gate of his palace, where was held ready his favorite horse and mounted on it: the generals and other distinguished personages waiting outside for his arrival wished him success by holding both their hands in the anjali pose over their bowed beads. The poem states that the Chola, the Kerala and the Pandya kings, baton in band, proceeded forward on foot to make way for Kampana's horse. The women-folk of the town threw fried rice on the person of Kampana, in benediction, voicing forth their prayer that he should obtain success in his expedition. 

In the course of five or six days Kampana crossed the borders of the Karnata coun try and renghed the town called Kantakanana,* where he pitched his camp for some time, awaiting a fair opportunity to attack king Champa. He marched his armies to Virinchipuram on the bank of the Palar, and making it his base of oporations, he entered the country of Champa ; aud in the fierce battle that took place between the contending armies of Kampana and the Dramida king, the latter, being beaten, rap away in the direction of his capital. But Kampala did not leave Champa alone, but pursued him, took his capital and made it his camp, from there to attack the strong fortress on the hill Rajagambhira, in which he bad taken refuge. In the siege that was laid to this hill-fortress, the army of Kanpana did much damage to that of Champa by arrows, while a large number of soldiers belonging to the army of Kampana died by the stones which were shot from the catapults set up in the fort above. After a hard siege of several days, the Karnata soldiers succeeded in scaling the hill with ladders and attacked the garrison inside the fort. Unable to bear any longer the charge of the Karnata army, Champaraja sallied forth to offer personal resistance to the assailants, However much the generals desired to fight with him in single combat, Kampána would not permit them to do so, reserving such an honour for himself. Champa and Kampana met each other in single combat, swords in band, and Champa was killed. Then prince Kampana proceeded victoriously to Kanchi, settled down there and began to rule the Tundirá-mandala with due observance of the dharmas appropriate to the varnas.

Making the large city of Marakata the best of government of the newly acquird province, Kampana, to please the people of the country, first reduced all texes and ruled sagaciously so as to be loved by all. The kings of the Magadha, Malava, Sevuna, Sinhala, Dramila, Kerala and Gaula countries waited at his gate to have an audience in his court. At home in his palace, prince Kampana sometimes spent his time in the enlightened company of poets and scholars, and sometimes with the ladies of the zenana, enjoying the pleasures approprio ate to the six ritus and the recreations proper to the various seasons, such as jalakrida and gathering flowers in gardens.

It is in this context that we learn that Gangadevi, the authoress, was the Queen of Kampana, for at the request of her royal consort, she revels in some beautiful descriptions of the rising moon etc.. [It is however unfortunate that in this particular part of the poem we find & large number of lacunae, which can be filled up only when more copies of the work are available ; and for this it is imperative that active search should be made by all frue lovers of the history of India for a better manucript. In spite of the gaps, we are still able to pursue the thread of the narrative.]

One day, a strange woman appeared before king Kampana and complained in the following strain about the occupation of the south by Turushkas, and its evil effects. "O King! The place known as Vyaghra puri (Chidambaram, Perumparra. puliyur) has become truly so, for tigers inhabit it now where men dwelt once ; the vimana (dome of the central shrine) of Srirangam is so dilapidated that now it is the hood of Adisesha alone that is protecting the image of Ranganatha from the falling debris. The lord of Gajaranya (Tiravapaikka, Jambukesvaram near Srirangam), who once killed an olephant to obtain its skin for his garment, has now again been reduced to the same condition, because he has been stripped bare of all clothing; while the garbhagriha (central shrine) of many an other temple is crumbling, its mandapas overgrown with vegetation and its ponderous wooden doors eaten up by white ants. In the temples which once resounded with the joyous music of the mridanga (a kind of drum), there is heard at present only the howl of the jackals that have made them their abode. The river Kaveri, that was curbed by proper dams and flowed in regular channels, has begun to breach in all directions. In the agraharas where the smoke was seen to curl up from the fire offerings (yagadhuma), we have now the offensive-smelling smoke issuing from the roasting of flesh by the Muhammadans, and the sonorous chant of the Vedas has been replaced by the harsh voice of these raffians. The beautiful coconut tres which once graced the gardens surrounding the city of Madura, have been cut down by these intruders, and in place of these, we have gruesome substitutes in the form of iron sula which are adorned with garlands of decapitated human heads strung together. The water of the river Tamraparni, which used to be rendered white by the gandal paste rubbed away from the breasts of youthful maidens at their bath, is now flowing red with the blood of cows slaughtered by these great sinners." Thus did the strange lady describe to Kampana, the fate that had overtaken the fair south, and drawing out from her girdle a resplendent sword, addressed the king once again as follows: 

> "O Sovereign! Once upon a time the divine Visvakarma, gathering the splinters from the weapons of all the Devas and smalting them together, shaped this strange sword and presented it to Paramesvara for gaining victory over the daityas. By performing a severe penance, one of the Pandya kings obtains it from Lord Parameshvara. With the help of this divine weapon the descendants of this race continued to rule the kingdom prosperously for a very long period; but by a misfortune the princes of the Pandya dynasty losi the virility of their sires. Agastya, having secured this remarkable sword, presents this now to you. By wielding this sword, you will attain unabating vigour and the weapons of the enemy will become powerless against you. Just as Krishna slew Kamsa in Mathura in olden times, O King I do you also proceed now to the Southern Madhura and slaughter the Mussalmen king, the enemy of the world, and set up several pillars of victory on the bridge of Rama (between the mainland and the island of Ramesvaram). During your adıninistration of the south, you should also build a strong dam across the Kaveri, and make her flow in & manner useful to the agricultural population......"

(Because thore are blanks at the beginning and the end of this portion, it is impopossible to ascertain who the strange lady was, who had plended so pathetically before Kampana, how she happened to obtain the divine sword and who had sent her on her mission. We should perhaps presume that she was herself a divine being, one of the guardian deities (nagara-devatas) of Madura, who, not being able to bear the sinful acts of the Mussalmans, had repaired to the asrama of Agastya, the family. priest of the Pandya kings and consequently perhaps the legitimate custodian of their heirlooms, and had obtained the sword from him for ridding the Madhurarajya of the Muhammadans.)

Lastly, the poem describes vividly the encounter between the armies of Kampana and the Sultan of the south. Finding that his army was getting routed, the Yavana king (the Muhammadan chief) of Madura came out to offer single combat to prince Kampana, which was readily accepted. After several attacks on each other, the crow-banner of the Muhammadan chief was first cut down and next the string of the bow held by him. Then, with swords in their hands, they came to close quarters, and after a few moments' engagement Kampana dispatched his opponent with a blow from his divine sword. The hand of the despoiler of the kingdom of the Ballals, and the subverter of those of the Cholas and the Pandyas thus fell at last on the ground and licked the dast, and the Devas showered celestial flowers from above on the victor. So much about the contents of the poem.

#### HISTORICAL VALUE
+++(Gap in the era used in this note seems to be 88 years behind Julian era. So, S. 1268 means 1356.)+++

Let us now proceed to examine critically the contents of the poem and show their great value for the construction of the history of the Vijayanagara kingdom for a short time after its foundation.

##### Kriyashakti and ministers
Be it noted that the incantions at the commencement of the work are addressed to Ganesh, then to Parvati and Paramesvara and then to the guru Kriyasakti. Kriyasakti was a famous Saiva teacher and a Kulagaru of the kings of the first Vijayanagara dynasty. He was held in very high esteem and veneration by them, as is evident from the way in which be is referred to in the inscriptions of Harihara II,

> विरूपाक्षः साक्षात् कुलपरमदैवं कुलगुरुः  
> क्रियाशक्त्याचार्यः कलि-कलभ+++(=गजशावक)+++-कण्ठीरव+++(=सिंःअ)+++-यशाः

> श्रीक्रियाशक्ति-देव-दिव्य-श्रीपाद-पद्माराधकः श्रीवीर-हरिहर-महाराजः

Prominent among his disciples stood the great Madhava Mantrin or Madhavamatya who has also deified him as an avatara of Siva, in a number of inscriptions. It is quite natural that, the authoress Gadgadevi, the Queen of Kampana, should at the outset of her work, liken the kulaguru of her husband to god Siva and invoke his blessings for the success of her literary production.

Madhava-Mantrin, the son of Chaunda-Bhatta of the Angirasa-gotra, was a minister of Bukka I and Harihara II, and He appears to have done much for the consolidation of the Vijayanagara Empire. Himself a great warrior, he waged war with the Turusukas in the province bordering on the western ocean and conquered theim and was made Governor of the province by Bukka I. He was also the renowned scholar, wrote the commentary called Tatparyadipika on the Satasamhita, set in order the deranged Upanishadic lore, and was consequently known as the उपनिषन्-मार्ग-प्रतिष्ठा-गुरुः ।

It has to be noted that Madhava-Mantrin was a different person from Madhavacharya, the encyclopedic author and commentator. Madhavacharya, was the son of Mayana of the Bharadvaja--gotra and was also the kulaguru and minister of Bukka I, and when he entered the ascetic order of life, he came to be known as Vidyaranya. His two brothers were Sayana and Bhoganatha, of whom the former distinguished himself like Madhava-Mantrin as a wielder of the pen, the sceptre, and the sword. Sayana who wrote the famous commentaries on the four Vedas in conjunction with his illustrious brother Madhavacharya, was the minister of Bakka I, Kampana, Sangama II and Harihara II, and he appears also to have taken part in Sangama's campaign against Champa. *

Harihara I lived, according to the latest inscription of his reign hitherto discovered, till S 1268, which is also the initial date of the reign of his brother Bakkadeva 1. Bukka advised his son Kampana to conquer the south only after his accession to the throne, that is, some time after S' 1268. Kampana and his general Goppana seem to have lived, till about S 1275, not far from the capital. It is from the year S. 1282 that Kampana figures as the governor of the Mulvagilu-rajya and in the course of one year his conquest extended over the Tondai-mandalam. An inscription dated S: 1293 is actually found engraved in the Siva temple at Achcharavakkam. The conquest of the Tondai-mandalam should therefore have occurred between S 1282 to 1283.

##### Tondai mandala conquest
Let us now turn our attention to the account of the subjugation of the Tondai-mandalam, as graphically parrated in the poem. It is stated that Kampana with a large army commanded by eminent generals first moved on to the bank of the river Palar (Dugdha-sarit) and encamped in the town of Virinchipuram.

It should be noted here that at the time of this event, as it is even now, the high road between the country on the east of the plateau of Mysore and the low-lying western taluks of the North Arcot distriot bordering on the Mysore State, lay through the Mugli and the Sinigunta passes in the Eastern Ghats, The former of these is in the Chittur taluk and the rise of the ghat is gradual, admitting of wheeled traffic. The Sinigunta pase, on the other hand, leads from Gudiyattam to Palmader and the road through it joins the road from the Mugli pase. The ascent up this pass is steep and an army consisting of a large number of elephants, horses and infantry, and carrying with it a long train of supply wagons, would naturally have chosen the easier route, namely, that through the Mugli pass.

The immediate object of the move was to attack and subjugate the powerful chief of the region bordering on the Palaru-the Champaraya, Samparaya or Sambuvaraya of the poem and the inscriptions. He appears to have ruled over a large tract of country with Padavidu as his stronghold and perhaps Conjeevaram as his capital. As soon as the army of Kampana was sighted at Virinchipuram, Sambuvaraya opposed its fording the river and gave battle to it near Virinchipuram. After some fighting, his army bad to suffer defeat at the hands of the powerful forces of the Vijayanagara king and it fled in the direction of Padavidu, with the enemy in hot pursuit. Sambuvaraya with a select portion of his army, however, took refuge in the strong fortress on the hill called the Rajagambhira hill near Padavidu, and defended it with all the strangth that be goud muster.

This Rajagambhira bill might be identified with either Padavidu-durg or Karnatik ghar. Padavidudurg is situated very near the village of Padavidu, whereas Karnatikghar is at a distance of seven or eight miles sonth. The latter was strongly fortified, and has even now the fort in a fairly good condition; so it was better fitted to offer an effective resistance to the attacks of a powerful army such as that of Kampana rather than Padavidudurgam. But the identification of Karnatik-ghar with the Rajagambhiramalai is negatived by one of the inscriptions found in Padavidu itself, which fixes the position of Rajagambhira hill near Muruga-mangalup-pattu; and as this village is in the Arni Division a little to the east of the fort of the Padavidudurgam, it is certain that only Padavidadurgam has to be equated with the Rajagambhira hill. This hill received its name from one Rajagambhira Sambuvarayan, an ancestor of the Champaraya of the time of Kampana. Rajagambhira Sambuvaraya lived in the reign of Rajaraja III as a subordinate of that Chola king and flourished about the Saka year 1180.*

In his Annual Report on Epigraphy for 1899 Mr. V. Venkayya has incorrectly identified the Rajagambhirarajya with the Pandya country, relying on the Tiruppuvanam grant which mentions Rajagambhira as a title of Jatavarman Kulasekhara; but in view of the data now available, this rajya connotes the country surrounding Padavidu and Pada vidudurgam, which belonged to Rajagambhira Sambuvaraya. The inscription of Kampana dated in S 1287, found in Tiruppukkuli near Conjeavaram which records that Kampana Udaiyar son of Bukkana Udaiyar became permanent on the throne after taking possession of Rajagambhirarajya no doubt refers to this heroic achievement panegyrised by his queen in the present kavya.

The Madhuravijaya is alone in stating that the Champa raya who opposed Kampena in the Rajagambhirarajya was killed by the latter. The Sanskrit Ramabhyudaya and the Saluvabhyudaya and the Telugu Jaimini Bharatam and the Varahapurana all agree in asserting that he was either defeated and reinstated in his original place or terrorised into obedience and vassalage, but never as having met with his end/ We do not know if the authoress of the Madhuravijaya has represented the opponent of her hero as having been killed, either through an inadvertance or as conscious artifice in tended to heighten the poetic effect of the narrative. If Rajanarayana Sambuvaraya, the contemporary of Kampana, were really killed and dead, this Champuraya who is said to have accompanied and helped Jini Gundeyadeva against the Sultan of the South should have been the son of the deceased Sambuvarayar; but it appears probable that Rajanarayana Sambuvarayar did not suffer death on the occasion of his vanquishment by Kampana.

Having conquered the Dravida king Sambuvarayar and reduced him to the position of a tributary, it was easy for Kampana to make Coojeevaram his residence. The occupation of Conjeevaram by Kampana should have taken place in the year S: 1283. It was while he was sojourning at Marakata-nagara as his capital that he is said to have been visited by a mysterious lady who presented him with the divine sword. The town of Marakatanagara has not yet been identified. It continued to be the seat of a Governor of the Vijayanagara Empire who was generally chosen from the members of the royal family. Virupaksha or Virappanna was ruling here and after him, Srigiri-bhupala, brother of Pratapa Devaraya II.*

##### Sriranga conquest
After receiving the divine sword from the unknown lady Kampana had to wait patiently for a long time to strike a well-timed blow at the Turushkas holding Srirangam and Madura. The Srirangam-Koyilolugu gives an account of the events that took place since the occupation of Kanchi by the representative of the Vijayanagara Empire.

From this quasi-historical temple chronicle we learn that Goppanarya, the Brahmana general of Kampana, was placed by his master in charge of the province of Senji (Gingi). He was a Srivaishnava by persuasion, and belonged to the Bharadvaja gotra and the Apastambs-sutra. On one occasion when he had gone to Tirupati on a pilgrimage, he found in the central shrine of the temple of Venkatesa an additional bronza image, and learnt on enquiry that it was the image of god Ranganatha of Srirangam, which, after having been taken away from that temple shortly before the Turushkas entered its to Tiru nArAyaNa-puram (Melkote) by way of Jyotishkudi, Tirumalirun cholai (Alagarkoyil), Kolikkodu (Calicut), and Pungapur, had been kept there for some time and had been finally brought to Tirupati (Tirumala). On hearing this account from the priests, Gonnanna induced them to permit bim to remove the image to his capital and keep it in puja there, until such time as the Mussalmans could be driven out of Srirangam. With the consent of the priests he took it, and housed it temporarily with puja in the beautiful rock-cut shrine on the hill at Singavaram, a suburb of Senji.

The chief of the Mussalman garrison that had been left behind at Srirangam, stayed for some time in the temple of Ranganatha, but finding his health suffering by his stay in the island, he removed his quarters to Samayavaram (Kannanur), situated at a distance of six miles to the north, which he fortified with the stones obtained by demolishing one of the outer enclosures of Srirangam. At this time, Singappiran, a Kaniyala-Brahmana of an adjoining village secured a post in the service of the Muhammadan chief, through the influence of a Hindu dancing-girl of Srirangam, who had entered into intimacy with that Mussalman solely with the object of saving the temple from destruction, and was continuing to discharge his duties apparently faithfully to his new master. As soon as the news of the establishment of powerful kingdom at Anegundi (Vijayanagara), the conquest of the Tondai-mandalana by the representative of that kingdom, and the establishment of a gubernatorial seat at Senji presided over by a Vaishnaya - Brahmana, reached the people of - Srirangam, Tirumapattun-nambi, the son of Singappiran, despatched Uttama-nambi, one of the sthalattar to Senji to inform Goppandryz that he would be communicating to the Governor news of the affairs of the Mussalmans from time to time, and that he should be prepared to start out with his army to crush the Muhammadans when the proper opportunity was intimated to him. Thus, then, was communication established between Senji and Samayavaram. Finally in S' 1293, just 10 years after Kampana occupied Conjeevaram, an invitation was sent to him by Tirumapattun-Nambi to march against the Muhammadans in Samayavaram and Srirangam, who had been degenerated by drink and debauchery and had become thoroughly powerless to resist an attack. Goppanarya proceeded against Srirangam, crushed the Mussalmans and re-set up the image of Ranganatha wlth great eclat.* On this occasion, old Vedanta-Desika returned also to Srirangam from his retreat at Satyamangalam and praised Goppanarya in two Sanskrit verses which were got engraved on the eastern wall of the first prakara of the Ranganatha temple. I Such is the account found in the Koyilolugu. I But we find at Tiruppallani very near Rampad an inscription of Kampana in the same year, S' 1293, clearly evidencing the fact that it was not only Srirangam that was wrested from the Mussalmans in S' 1293, but also the tract round Madura ruled over by them. +

In his South India and her Muhammadan Invaders, Dr. S. Krishnasvami Ayyangar has suggested that the events recorded in the Kamparayacharita should have happend between the years A. D. 1343-56. Tho coins of the Sultans of Madara disclose the names of as many as eight Sultans ---Ahsan Shah, Alauddin Udanji, Qutbu-d-din. Ghiyathu-d. din, Nasiru-d-din, Adil Shah, Fakru-d-din Mubarak-Shah and Alaud-d. din Sikhandar Shah, who had ruled for short periods from A. D. 1335 to 1348 and from A. D. 1356 to 1377, with an inexplicable interregnum of 12 years noted above. This blank is, according to the learned Doctor, explainable only by the possible victories of Kampana, and the restoration of the Ranganatha images, two of them--the original and a duplicate, has also been similarly interpreted.- GH.

There is no denying the fact that there was a Muhammadan principality established at Madura which issued coins of its own. One of these coins bears on its obverse the words "Ahsan Shah 738" (of Hijra, i, e., A. D., 1337-8) and the reverse “Al Hussiniyyu." One of the Sultans therefore seems to have been named Ahsan Shah, and since he lived in S. l259, the person that should have suffered defeat and death at the hands of Kampana must be one of the successors of Ahsan Shah. It took for Kampana ten years after his conquest of Champaraya to attack and defeat the Sultan of the South. Ever since this signal victory, the whole of the peninsula south of the Tangabhadra became practically the possession of the Vijayanagara Empire. The barrier in the shape of the Empire of Vijayanagara, which was raised by the hand of Providence to protect the virgin south from that ravishment her sister Northern India had suffered at the merciless and vandalistic bands of the Muhammadans, continued intact for over two centuries until the fateful year A. D. 1565, when the magnificent Empire was sbattered at the battle-field of Talikota by the copfrederacy of the Sultans of Bijapur, Golconda, etc., and the south became once again a prey to anarchy and disorder. Providence, at this juncture, ushered on the stage the British nation, who have once again restored order and peace over the whole of India.

One other fact worth noticing here is the mention of two sons of Bukka, both having the same name, kampana. Inscriptions of Hiriya (or the eider)-Kampana and Chikka (or the younger)-Kampana are met with in the Madras Presidency and in the Mysore State. It has been the custom of the Epigraphists of the Madras Government to assign to the elder Kampana, son of Bukka, all the inscriptions which call the prince by the names Chikka-Kampsna, Kumara Kampada, Vira Bukkaraya Kumar Kampana; similarly, all those which used the prefix Hiriya, eto., before the name of Kampana were assigned to his paternal uncle Kampana.

Below is appended a table for easily understanding the relationships subsisting between the members of the first Vijayanagara dynasty, who are referred to in the course of this article: -

- Sangama I,
  - Harihara I.
  - Kampa I.
    - Sangama 2
  - Bukka I.
    - Hiriya Kampana 
    - Chikka Kampana
    - Sangama III
  - Muddapa
  - Marappa
  - Sangama II.


The introduction in the Madhuaravijaya, of another Kampana in the already confused state of the genealogy of the first Vijayanagara dynasty produces still greater confusion and difficulty in the way of a proper understanding of the value of the stone and the copper-plate dcouments that are unearthed from time to time. Confusion or no confusion, it is the duty of the historian to face the situation boldly and offer a scientific, explanation of the facts brought to his notice. We know as a fact that Kampa, the brother of Harihara I, held the government of the province of Udayagiri-rajya, under the title and design stion of the Lord of the Eastern and the Western Oceans, ** and he seems to have died sometime before S' 1268-9, the date of the death of Harihara 1, and of the accession of Bukka 1. If he had not died before that year, it is difficult to understand how Bukka, the third son of Sangama, could have ascended the throne even when his second son Kampa was alive. The grant said to hove heen made by Sangama 2, the son of Kampa I, on the annual ceremony of his father (the Bitragunta Plates, Ep. Ind. Vol. III), in the year S' 1278, should have been made on the tenth anniversary or so of his father, and not the first, this connection, attention has to be drawn to the wording employed in the document, namely, that the occasion of the granting of the village recorded in the Bitra gunta plates was the pratyabda-kala, meaning the day on which the apnual ceremony fell, and therefore it need not necessarily imply the first of such occassions only. If now it is granted that Kampa I was dead long ago, any inscription dated after S 1268, the presumed date of death of this prince, and having the name Hiriya Kampana in it, should necessarily be ascribed to the older son of that name of Bukka I, and those giving the name of the prince as Chikka-Kampana should be allotted to the reign of the younger son. Anyhow, it has become now imperative to bear in mind the existence of one more Kampa, a younger brother of Kampana, the vanquisher of the Sultan of the South.

Then again, the name Devayi, the queen of Bukka I, is also a new one ; and as no inscription zuentions a name such as this among the queens of Bukka I, the kavya by giving out the name of the mother of Kampana has added one more fact to the stock of our knowledge of the Soata Indian History.

The inscriptions belonging to the time of Kampana are found in many parts of the southern districts of the Madras Presidency and in Mysore, covering a period ending with S’ 1296, Ananda. He was alive, at least, till the first tithi of the bright fortnight of the Karttika month in the year Ananda; on that day he had done something which is not clear in the inscription, while yet he was ruling the earth. * A month after, Kampana seems to have died in Margasirsha, for his son Jammana-Udaiyar is found ruling over the Marataka-nagara province, a fact which distinctly enables us to infer that Kampana was dead and Jammana ascended the gubernatorial seat of his father. There is also direct proof for this surmise in inscriptions; for two records found in Tiruvannamalai and Eyil and dated in the year S 1296 † clearly mention that Janman made certain gifts for the merit of his deceased father. The demise of Kampana some time before his father Bukka accounts for the accession of his younger brother, Harihara II, to the throne; if he were alive, he would have contributed to the shedding of greater quantity of blood in the disputes of succession, which followed soon after the death of Bakka. (See Ep. Ind. Vol. XII, p. 162 about these disputes). Bukka died on a Sunday, the first tithi in the dark fortnight of the month Phalguna, in the year Nala corresponding to S'1298, that is, about two years after Kampana. The strenuous life of Kampana has thus contributed to the expansion of the dominions of the Vijaya Dagara Empire and to the governing of the subjugated provinces with wisdom and justice; he lived in the Tamil country for nearly thirteen years from S'1283 to 1296.

#### VASSALS OF KAMPANA
This account of the life and the achievements of Kampana will not be complete, if we do not mention a few words regarding those faithful vassals who helped him throughcut his career of stunning success in war and beneficent administration of the country. 

We have seen how the brahmana general Goppanna, the Governor of Senji, was rendering his services of a general and statesman. He was an officer under Kampana even so early as S'1275. 

The minister of Kampana was Somappa-Udaiyar (Aramane Mahapradhani). 

Saluva Mangi was, according to the Salu vabhyudaya and the Ramabhyudaya, one of the officers who accompanied Kampana in his campaigns against Cambuvaraya and the Sultan of the South; and for the meritorious services he rendered to his liege-lord, he was styled Samburaya-sthapanachorga and for his munificent gifts to the brahmanas of Sriranga, Sriranga-sthapanacharya. 

Then two persons are mentioned in inscriptions as the Mahasamantadhipatis, that is, field-marshals of Kampana; they are Ramayyadeva and Mallappanavaru, and they were with him in S' 1283-4. 

The name of the palace manager (aramanaikku Sarvanirvahakar) was one Duggana and Adappattu Ilakkappar was his betelbearer, Pradhani Somappa-danda-nayakar and Annar-Goppannar are also mentioned in the Srirangan-Koyilologu.

From what has been discussed above, it would become evident how very valuable this manuscript happens to be for the intelligent construction of the history of the early period of the Vijayanagara Empire.
