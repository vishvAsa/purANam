A poem may be sound,   
but unless sweet

A wife may be faithful,  
but unless pretty  
she will not please her spouse.

</details>

<details><summary>tiruvenkaTAchAri (Eng)</summary>

19. Just as an ugly woman, though virtuous, is not pleasing to her husband, a faultless poetic compo sition, if devoid of qualities (fineness), does not satisfy the man of learning.  

</details>

Roiling the whole host of hostile kings,  
vast as the ocean,  
with the mountain of his globe-bearing arm –  
child’s play for him –  
he produced his own *amṛta*, fame.[^1]
