‘In Śrīraṅga,  
Śeṣa, king of snakes,  
fearing lest Viṣṇu his master  
be rudely awoken from meditative slumber,  
shields him from the broken bricks that keep falling  
with his thousandfold hoods.

‘Other temples too –  
shutter-doors devoured by woodworm,  
festival halls with *dūrvā* grass sprouting boldly from each crack,  
sacredmost shrines crumbling –  
drive me to tears when I see them.

‘Earlier, *agrahāras* were filled  
with the scented smoke of continuous sacrifice,  
with the sound of Vedic chanting.  
Now, they are swamped  
with the stink of raw meat,  
with the drunken roars of inebriate Turks.

‘In Madhurā’s gardens  
great swathes of coconut groves have been cut down  
and all about  
serried spikes stand  
swaying under the hundreds of long-dead human heads

To see it is to weep.

a terrifying sword.

This sword was a string of blue lilies adorning the ears

Placing it before the doughty king,  
daring as Indra, destroyer of cities,  
she spoke once again.
