The archaic skandapurANa lists the daitya dynasty & the order of incarnation-s differently from the narratives of other purANa-s: 

1. hiraNyakashipu: slain by viShNu (nR^isiMha) 
2. hiraNyAkSa: slain by viShNu (varAha) 
3. andhaka: slain by rudra 
4. prahlAda: slain by indra & viShNu
5. virochana: slain by indra 
6. bali: trampled by viShNu 
   

The archaic skandapurANa places the battle between daitya-s led by prahlAda & the gods occurs during the churning of the world-ocean.
