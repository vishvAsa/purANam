अथ वरतनुभिः समं कदाचि-

One day thereafter  
the King set out to the pleasure grove  
to pass the time in picking flowers  
with his graceful queens –  
just as the noble Indra sets out for his garden Nandana  
with heaven’s beauties.

As he strode ahead,  
the oval-eyed ladies,  
jingling with jewel-girt girdles,  
trailed in his wake –  
just as garden creepers,   
humming with bees,  
trail the Malaya breeze.

The King mistook  
the peal of the ornamented anklets  
worn by the dark-eyed girls  
for the sound of the sugarcane bow  
as if Kāma,  
moving among them,  
were readying his aim.

As they followed their lord,  
the doe-eyed women,  
voices sweet as seeping honey,  
chattered each to her neighbour,  
their many-wayed words like waves.

‘Step to the side there –  
slowly now, my love!  
Mind you don’t tread here –  
the plenteous pearl necklaces coming loose  
as the doe-eyed women ahead pick up pace  
are making a gravel of the place.’

‘Look out, lady of the lotus face!  
Don’t awaken the *haṃsas*  
fast asleep here  
with the ringing of your jewelled anklets.  
They’d be sure to cling to your feet,  
which look so like lotuses,  
and stop you from hurrying ahead.’[^1]

[^1]: *Haṃsas* are attracted to the sound of anklets as well as being fond of lotuses.

‘An antelope is following you,  
hopelessly hypnotised

Oh do have a look, dear!  
He has scampered off,  
evidently embarrassed.’

‘Is it for fear of slipping  
on the moonstone-paved path,  
my moon-faced girl,  
that you falter over footstep after footstep?[^2]  
And this is the reflection  
repeated over and over  
of your own face;  
not a fresh offering of blown lotus flowers.’

[^2]: Moonstones ooze water upon seeing the moon.

The King,  
lusting after one girl,  
splashed her lotus face with water.  
But it was another whose  
eyelashes ran wet  
and eyes turned red.

As another girl turned away,  
fearing a slap of water,  
the King believed the braid whipping across her back  
was the fish-bannered Kāma’s sword  
swinging across his shield.

Wiping the paint from his wives’ lips,  
the alluring collyrium from their eyes  
and the decorative dot forthwith from their foreheads –  
just as lovemaking does –  
these watersports enthralled the King.

Though many a time did their beloved ask,  
they left not their much-loved bask,  
their *tilaka* and sandal paste in every way faded,  
those beautiful wives of his in no way jaded.

At length from the water the Lord with his lovers emerged

As his voluptuous wives tied their hair  
and changed into fresh clothes,  
King Kampa considered himself luckier than Kāma  
to be granted a glimpse  
of those spots he longed to see,  
without lifting a finger.

Then the King, suitably attired by the dress-maidens,  
entered the inner quarters with the eldest matrons.  
There he worshipped,  
in accordance with *śāstra*,  
the divine light to whom the triple *Vedas* pay tribute,  
tormentor of Tripura[^3],  
and spent the rest of the day in fitting occupations.
