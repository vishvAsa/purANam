## 1 विश्वं
Full in all respects Here at the outset, the all-round fullness and perfection of भगवान् is delineated by the word "Visvam". This word is derived from the root "vis" to enter, with the addition of the "kvan" suffix according to a grammatical rule, in the sense of "He enters" (all the parts). In the मोक्ष-धर्म of महाभारतः , पञ्चशिक्ष explains this word "विश्वं" to संयम as follows:- " O the king of काशि They say भगवान् is "विश्वं" because He enters all the words. O King! They also say that the worlds themselves are called " विश्वं". It is propounded that भगवान् is perfect and full to the brim with reference to His essential nature, form, qualities and glory, all of which are natural, Unexcelled, superior and auspicious. The word विश्वं denotes entirety and it is quite fitting that the fact of Bhagavँn being the possessor of unlimited and immense glory is declared even in the beginning. " विश्वं" is in the neuter gender. As it is the name of विष्णु one may expect it to be in masculine gender. But the gender of a word is determined by usage and not by grammar alone. Some opine that the word " विश्वं" which generally connotes "effect" is here used to denote the cause. This view cannot stand; because भगवान् alone is the primary and direct import of all the namesb here, both by etymological derivation and conventional usage. It is incorrect to adopt the view that भगवान् is only the secondary import of the names. There are others who explain that the word " विश्वं" connotes the identity of ब्रह्मन् and the Universe. This theory does not take us in the right path. To explain - the word " विश्वं" does not signify identity. It may be argued that identity can be arrived at as in the case of the उपनिषद Manthra "तत् त्वं असि " and the identity of the two is postulated. Our reply is that, that argument cannot be applied here. Firstly, there is no co-ordination of two words. Secondly, all are proper names each of which is an independent unit and they are not co- nducive to the idea of identity. Again there is a difference in the genders of names as for example "विश्वं" which is in the Neuter gender and "विष्णु" in the Masculine gender. We can see that the entirety or fullness that is depicted here is elaborated by all the names beginning with "विष्णु".

## 2 विष्णु
One who pervades This name connotes that भगवान् pervades all that He possesses. He enters into all the sentient and non-sentient things that are His wealth. The Sruthi declares. "He entered all the beings, movable and immovable", "He entered into the same." "Kesava exists everywhere, having pervaded all these worlds. Therefore Thy name is विष्णु since the root vis denotes entry i.e. "pervasion". The word विष्णुis formed by the addition of the suffix 'knu' to the root 'vis' which means 'to enter'. The suffix 'knu' is added to show that the quality is ever innate in Him. By this, it is taught that this greatness of विष्णु is quite natural to Him. The first name विश्वम् refers to the fullness, and the second name (विष्णु) to pervasion. Therefore there is no redundance.

## 3 वषट्कारः
- One who controls and directs (not merely pervades). The object of the pervasion of the Universe by भगवान as distinguished from that byआकाश (ether) is stated here by this name. He makes all act according to His will - hence the name 'वषट्कार'. The root is 'vas' meaning कान्ति (lustre) and the suffix 'at' is added. The substitute 'sha' takes the place of 'sa' in the root 'vas'. The upanishad declares. " He is the controller of all and the Ruler of all". "This Universe is under His Control."

## 4 भूतभव्यभवत्प्रभुः
The master of all things in the past, future and present. He is therefore that Master of all things t hat exist in all the three periods of time. Prabhu-स्वामी and शेषी-Lord and Master. The suffix 'du' is added to roots (like भू ) when the prepositions like 'vi' and 'pra' are prefixed. The grammatical rule lays down that if the result- ing word is a name, the 'du' suffix should not be added. Here the word 'Prabhu' is only part of a word which is a name and so 'du' has been affixed. Thus do the शास्त्रा proclaim:- "(He who is) the Lord of the Universe" "The Lord of Lords". "He is the one Lord of all beings" "This Universe belongs to that पुरुष." "All these directions and quarters are His" "This universe of moving and non-moving things exists indeed for the sake of श्रीकृष्ण ." "केशवा, the slayer of केशी (the Asura) is the Lord of the past, present and future" "He is the Lord of the world, O' King" And other such texts.

## 5 भूतकृत्-
The creator of all beings. He creates all things without depending on anything else . The Sruthis declare: "All these have been verily created by Brahman ( भगवान् )". "From Him all beings are born".

## 6 भूतभृत्-
The supporter of all things. He bears all things. "He supports the universe and He is the navel of the Earth." " As in a car, the circumference of the wheel is placed on the spokes, and the spokes on the navel, even so the subtle elements (i.e. the body) rest on the subtle intelligence (i.e. the जीव ); and the subtle intelligence rests on the प्राण ( the vital airs i.e. परमात्मा )." "He bore the Earth". " The indestructible Lord bears" - Gंtha.

## 7 भावः
He who exists Like a peacock with its expanded feathers, He exists possessed of all the riches mentioned already and to be mentioned hereafter. "This word has been derived from the root 'bhu' (bhavathi)by the addition of the suffix 'na'. Since all things are his attributes (प्रकरण ), and He as the substratum has them all in Him, they are delineated as His riches or glories ( विभूति ).

## 8 भूतात्मा
The soul of all beings. This state of all things being the possessions of Bhagavan and His being the possessor is particularised by saying that they are His body and He their soul (i.e.the individual soul) is described as the soul of the body that belongs to it. That is because the soul enters into the body, directly controls and directs all its activities. परमात्मा does the same with reference to all beings. The nature of the relationship between the soul and the body is distinct from and more intimate than the relationship between the indiv- idual soul on the one hand and the wife, house, field etc. on the other hand. Numerous passages from the वेदा and पुराण-s can be cited in support of this view. Here are a few of them: "He who is in the Earth" "He who is in the आthma" "He Whose body the Earth is" "This (भगवान् ) is the Inner soul of all beings" "The entire Universe is Thy body" "All of them are His body" "All that is indeed the body of Hari."

## 9 भूतभावनः
He who nourishes all beings He is Bhu:tha-भाvanah because He makes all beings grow by bestowing on them things that sustain them, nouriSH them and contribute to their enjoyment. It may be taken that the affix 'lyu' is added here according to the rule that 'lyu' may be added after 'nandi' and other words. Or it may be taken that the affix 'lyut' is added here to denote the agent of an act. The names "भाvanah" (32) and "Prathardana(60) are also to be taken as words ending with the 'lyut' suffix. "He is the Sustainer of the Universe and also the Lord of the Universe" "He is the Protector of beings" Thus His mastery (शेषित्व) has been established by virtue of His being the Creater, Sustainer, Director and Protector. The term '' (Master) signifies one for whose purpose or benefit an object is created and nourished. The पूर्व मीमांसा सूत्र says: "That object is called 'शेष' (or Subordinate) which exists for the benefit of another."

## 10 पूतात्मा
The pure self . Though भगवान is the Soul of all objects, unlike the individual souls He is not affected by the defects of the Sentient and non-sentient objects which are His body. That is, He is pure by nature. Though the contact with the body is similar to both परमात्मा and जीवात्मा, the lower soul (i.e. the individual soul) alone reaps the fruits of his actions and is subject to suffering. The Sruthi declares - "The other Aja (unborn, i.e. जीवात्मा eaves it after it has been enjoyed. But the Supreme Soul ( परमात्मा ) who makes the other experience joy or sorrow because of His free will and independence, not only does not enjoy it, but also shines brilliantly. This can be explained by an analogy: when a teacher beats a student with a cane the contact with the cane is the same both for the teacher and the student. It is only the student who is beaten that experiences the pain of the beating but not the teacher who beats. This is taught to us by various texts :- "The other ( परमात्मा ) Who does not eat, shines with all brilliance." "He is the inner soul of all beings and is devoid of all sins". "Actions do not taint Me" - (गीत ). "Narada! Look at the superiority and greatness of the Lord ( परमात्मा), who is never tainted by actions, good or bad." The Brahma सूत्र says : "If you, who hold the prima facie view say that परमात्मा too (owing to His association with the body) will exp- erience the fruit of an act, we say, no. For by nature He is superior to all."

## 11 परमात्मा
The supreme Soul Unlike all beings which have Him as their Inner Soul, परमात्मा does not have any one as His Inner Soul (आत्म ). Therefore भगवान् is called परमात्मा. The word 'Parama' is derived thus: 'parah मा asya' meaning ' He who has no one superior to Him; The form 'parama' is gramm- atically correct on the analogy of the word 'paramah' (Supreme) and 'आthma' (Inner soul). That is to say there is no ruler above Him who controls Him. The following passages establish this fact: "He who is the ruler of His own आthma." "There is no one who is superior to Him." "Nothing is seen which equal or superior to Him." "Superior to Him there is no one whatsoever." "The best of भारता-s! Nothing is seen which superior to the Lotus- eyed (Lord)." "Greater than the Lotus-eyed (Lord) there was nothing (in the past) not will there be (in the future)." "There is no God greater than केशव ." "Nothing is higher than the Parama-पुरुष , who is without end, beginning or middle." "Greater than Myself there is nothing else." "There is no greater nectar than भगवान् of Universal form." "He is greater than the great. He is superior and He is the Supreme Soul."

## 12 मुक्तानां
परमा गतिः- He, who is thus the Supreme goal for all the Released Souls ( मुक्ता-s). They are called the Released Souls who once for all and completely are free from the enshrouding coverings which are the results of the bondage of the Primordial Matter, nescience latent impressions of actions and their fruitions. Here are some passages from the scriptures:- "(The उपासक ) casts off his merits and sins (पुण्यः and पापः ). "Ever as a horse shakes its hair (to get rid of the dust), he casts off his sins." "shaking off the merits and sins". "Then the learned उपासक becomes freed from name and form." "When he realises God, he is released from all bonds." "The knot binding the heart is cut." "They cross this माय (i.e. संसार )". (गीत ). श्री नारायणीय (महाभारत ) teaches: -- "Those, who are bereft of the seventeen qualities and actions, give up the fifteen 'Kalas' (or lores) and become Released Souls. This is certain." Note- Seventeen qualities Five Elements, fiveज्ञानेन्द्रियs, five कर्मेन्द्रियs, mind and time. The sixteens parts (Kalas) are mentioned in the प्रस्नोपनिषद्. It has been established in the Scriptures that those, who have been freed from all the shackles of संसार attain equality with परमात्म, the Supreme Soul, in regard to the essential nature which is full of unlimited knowledge and Bliss, in re- gard to the eight qualities beginning with "being devoid of all sins" and end- ing with "unfailing will" and also in regard to the enjoyment of Beatitude. "Witnessing the desired objects through his celestial eye and mind, he is happy." "Becoming devoid of all sins, he attains utmost equality with the Lord." "They attain a state of equality with me (like Myself in regard to the poss- ession of auspicious qualities)." "बद्रायण affirms that there is no contradiction between the two statements that the Muktha's essential nature is knowledge only and that they are end- owed with many qualities. This is because of earlier statements according to which the pure soul is bereft of all blemiढes, and full of auspicious qualities." It is further established that the Released Souls attain a similarity with परमात्म even in regard to their bodies which are composed of unmixed and supreme सत्वगुण (Suddha-Saththva). "He becomes one, he becomes one (he becomes two fold)." "He eats, plays and enjoys." "He enjoys whatever he desires, assumes whatever form he wants and follows (The Lord)." "The fragrance of Brahman enters into him." "The taste of Brahman enters into him." "The celestial damsels adorn him with the decorations of the Brahman Itself. "बद्रायण holds the view that the Released Souls are in two forms (i.e. with a body or without a body as they like). It is like the सोम Sacrifice,' द्वादशाः ' by name, which is to be done for twelve days and which is of two kinds (either with one master or many masters) or (either for prosperity or for progeny.) Here the word 'मुक्तानां' used in the plural number shows clearly that the Released souls are many and are different from one another. So do the Scriptures declare. "All become free by the grace of theपरमपुरुष." "The worshippers of परमपुरुष become great and attain the Transcendent world of Bliss (परमपद )." "They attain a state of equality with me in regard to the possession of auspicious qualities like Myself." "They attain Me." As it is stated here itself that 'He is a witness." (साक्षी -names 15 and 517) and that He is the object of attainment by the मुक्ताs ( Released Souls), it is clear that there is difference between गवान् and Released Souls. So do the Scriptures declare. "When the उपासक sees the Lord as being pleased with him and also realises His Greatness, he becomes bereft of all sorrow." "When he understands that the आत्मा (individual Soul) (which is driven about) and He परमात्म, (who drives him) are different." "The Released Soul attains the परमपुरुष." "The Released Soul enjoys all bliss along with the omniscient Brahman." "He attains the Lord of Supreme Effulgence." "It is stated that परमात्म is attained by the Released Soul." It is also clearly stated in मोक्षधर्म (महाभरत): "He is Lord नारायण and He must be known as the Supremeपुरुष and the Inner Soul of all beings. Just as the lotus leaf is not tainted by water. He is not tainted by any dirt (i.e.blemish). He who is the other, is known as कर्मात्म and is the victim of bondage and release. He becomes associated with all the seventeen (qualities). Note The seventeen qualities are : Fiveकर्मयोगs five ज्ञानयोगs, five भूतs, mind and time. From all these, this theory is dispelled by theशास्त्र themselves, theory viz, that Brahman itself, circumscribed by a real or unreal उपाधी (i.e. a limiting adjunct) becomes a pray to the worldly miseries like the other circumscribed in a vessel, and that there is absolutely no difference in the state of Release between the Supreme Brahman itself", which speak of non-difference betw- een the two are reconciled with the other view that those two are different. This is in analogy with the statement. "This is a cow" in regard to those which have broken horns or without horns. All the cows under the genus of cows are called as such, though there is an external difference - some having broken horns and some not so. In the case of those who say that there is non- difference, statements which affirm non-difference and which affirm similarity between Brahman and Jंvas in the state of Release will co- ntradict each other. अनुपाधिक-भेद-वादिनs (i.e. those who hold the view that non-difference is the truth and difference is caused by limiting adjuncts) accept that there is an bond to the entity of the Muktha or Released Souls. In that case the state of Release will cease to be an object to be desired or longed for; again it will be against the statements that declare that existe- nce of difference in the state of Release. The supreme similarity (betwe- en the परमात्म, the Muktha) which we have delineated has been described as non-difference. So (अभेद्य ) the non-difference delineated in the Upani- shads refers only to the similarity of the qualities and not to the non-exis- tence of the entity of Muktha as such.) The विष्णपुराण explains this as follows: "तद भावा-भावं आपन्नाः तदा असु परमात्मना भवति अभेदे" thasya-pertaining to परमात्म ;भावनः-qualities like knowledge, strength etc. तेषां भावः - their manifestation i.e., similarity of qualities. In the interpre- tation given by others, the second word 'भाव' would be purposeless. "This Muktha (Released soul) attains a nature which is similar to that of परमात्म. Then he becomes non-different from परमात्म" The Prohibition of difference in the state of Release has been indicated to be with reference to the adventitious conditions as good and the like (by the sameविष्णु पुराण) as follows. "There is no longer the difference in the form of gods and the like; that shroud (i.e. Karma, which has been concealing the similarity between the जीव and theपरमात्म) has been dispelled. This word 'gathi' (in the name "मुक्तानाम परमाँ गतिः") has at its end the suffix 'kthin' in the sense of the passive. 'Gathih' means attainment. A word in the Accusative case (i.e. objective case) refers to an object which is most desired; and that is the goal of attainment. By this it is shown that the relationship between the Released Soul and परमात्म, the object of attainment, is that of servant and master. The Vedic मन्त्राs say: "Having attained the Supreme Soul (परमात्म) full of bliss." "(The Muktha) follows Him" "By that path by which परमात्म moves, by the same path the Muktha goes with Him. This is similar to a young cow going after its calf or a calf foll- owing its mother-cow." "Like the shadow of an object that goes with the object wherever it goes." In the same manner (does the Muktha follow theपरमात्म). It is from the Sc- riptures that we know about the existence of जीवात्म and परमात्म. The same scriptures reveal that the जीवात्म is 'Sesha' or subordinate toपरमात्म and that this subjection is natural to him like knowledge and other qual- ities of his and in the state of Release this attribute of subjection is not negatived. On the other hand, because of the removal of obstruction, it becomes manifest. "He becomes endowed with the form natural to him (which was conce- aled till now)" says (the chandogya Upanishad). विष्णु dharma also states: "Just as the radiance of a gem is not newly created, (but only made mani- fest) when the dirt on the gem is removed by polishing, so too knowledge and other such qualities are indeed quite natural to him (and are always there though latent at some times (i.e. in संसार). "Oh! The ruler of Men! Knowledge and non-attachment riches and virtue - all these four qualities are eternally present in the जीवात्म who is like Brah- man Itself because of his similarity." The Brahma सूत्र also confirms this; " When the Muktha attains the Brahman, there is the manifestation of his essential nature which is his own. This is revealed by the use of the word 'svena' (his own) as an adjective qualifying the noun रूपेन' (his essential nature or form)". Here an objection is raised: "He attains independence". "He becomes a sovereign". After quoting these texts, the independent sta- tus of a Muktha is establisheed by the following Brahma सूत्र; "For that very reason he has none as (his) lord." Against all this, how can it be said that he exists for the benefit of another and how can the undesirable state of a depe- ndent be predicated about him? Dunce! Don't become an object of ridicule. Here the import of the word 'Ananya-adhipathithvam' (i.e.being without another master ) is that He is under the control of भगवान् only, who is His own Master. The domination of other things like distress and karma over the Muktha has been removed. This does not mean that he is an 'अनाथ ' (i.e. one without a master to save him). If that were the case, the word 'अनाधइ पति ' (which means without a master ) would have been used, and not 'ananya-adhipathih' (which means 'without another master'). In the case of a wife, being subject to a greatly loving husband is not loathsome to her for we see that even kings and others are eagerly served and subserved by their sweet hearts and others when they do what is most pleasing to them. Again and again it has been indicated that it is the qualities that occupy a place of importance (and not any thing else). It has been establiढed in the Brahma सूत्रs that the equality between the परमात्म and the जीवात्म is only with reference to the enjoyment of Bliss and excludes the state of being the ruler on the one hand and the ruled on the other. "The जीवीत्म is like theपरमात्मa Himself except with reference to the activities regarding the Universe, Viz. Its creation, destruction etc." "There are clear indicatons to ढow that the equality of the जीवीत्म and परमात्म is only in the enjoyment of Supreme Bliss." Here are other texts in support of this view:- श्री विष्णु तत्वा- 1. "The Muktha attains complete subjection to परमपुरुष. He gets rid of all bondage and attains unparalleled freedom. He enjoys all Bliss along with the परमपुरुष." "With the जीवीत्म the state of being a property (that is possessed) rests and the state of being the owner or possessor rests with परमात्म. This is the relationढip between the two. Nothing else appeals to me." श्री नारायणीय (महाभारत)- "At the end of the observance of our vow, we saw men with highly auspicious qualities, white, bright like the moon and endowed with all lovely features. Their hands were joined in prayer at all times, and they were meditating upon the Brahman with their faces turned towa- rds north east." "With their hands joined in prayer they are always happy and are always repeating the word 'namah' (which means salutations unto Thee)". "They have controlled the sense-organs, and remain without food. They do not perpire and are always sweetsmelling." These and other such texts describe the residents of स्वेत-द्वीप (the Holy White Island ) and say that they are endowed with divine features and the like, and they derive great pleasure in being the servants of the Lord and in doing unceasing service to Him. The same is said to be the state and occupation of the Mukthँs or Released Souls. This is reiterated by the following text: "The best among the भारताs! Those men who are released from here have the same characteristics as those who are the residents of स्वेत-द्वीप (The Holy White Island)." By the use of the word 'परमा' (highest) as an adjective qualifying 'gathih' (goal) (in the phrase 'परमा gathih) it should be understood that there are some for whom the goal is of a lower order. Such a goal, which goes by the name of Kaivalya, is resorted to by those souls who are free from old age, death etc. (श्री कृष्ण says in the गीत ). "They resort to me and make efforts to be devoid of old age and death." It is stated that such a place (Kaivalya by name) is some where between संसार (material world) and Paramapada (Transcendental word). "That is the eternal world of those yogins who are satisfied with enjoyment of the Bliss of their own individual soul." Such is the Supreme Goal of the मुक्ताs. "He is the Highest means; He is the Supreme Goal." "He who is the inner Soul of the universe and the highest goal". "(They attain) Me, the unsurpassed Goal." "He reaches the end of the road (i.e.परमात्मा)." "There is nothing greater than the attainment of the (Supreme) आत्मन् ". Texts like these can be easily got. That भगवान् is the Supreme Goal of attainment, for, the Mukthas is corro- borated by the next five names (13 to 17).

## 13 अव्ययः
He by whom Mukta is not sent away. The word is derived from the verb 'na वीयते .' His name is Avyaya, because no one is sent away by Him. The suffix added is 'erach'. The names प्रत्या' (94), 'विनयः' (510)'जयः' (511) and the like belong to this group (which has this particular suffix). Is it not a well-known fact that the भगवान् never sends back that आत्म who has, by some means and with great effort, crossed the vast ocean of संसार and has reached His lotus-feet. That is why the Vedas declare- "They who go by this path (i.e. अर्चिरादि-गतीi) attain भगवान् and) do not come back to this mortal world." "He does not return; he does not return" "There is no return according to the scripture. There is no return according to Scripture." Yama स्मृति i Says: - "The Muktha bears a body of pure and subtle Saththva and attains the Supreme Lord who is the परमात्मा and नारायण as well as the glorious and superior वैकुण्ठा . Then he becomes fit for immortality and does not come back (to this world) any more." dealing with yathi-dharma (the code of the सन्यासि ) says:- "One who has taken to the life of a yathi (Recluse) is calm equally disp- osed towards all beings and self-controlled. He attains the highest place (i.e.वैकुण्ठा ) and after reaching it, never comes back".

## 14 पुरुषः
The generous Giver He bestows gifts in plenty. 'Puru' means plenty, and 'sanothi' the verb signifies the act of giving. The suffix 'da' is added when the root 'san' is preceded by the particle 'puru'. The rule says that it is added even in the case of other particles. भगवान् indeed bestows even on the Mukthas the enjoyment of the Bliss of Himself, His qualities and His glory all of which are beyond the range of words and mind. Here are the Vedic मन्त्राs that reveal this:- "He (भगवान् ) alone confers Bliss" "He (The Muktha) enjoys all desirable things along with the omniscient Brahman." "By his celestial eye and mind he (the Muktha) sees all desirable things and enjoys." "There the Muktha enjoys all kinds of bliss. He eats, plays and experie- nces joy." "He enjoys all that he desires and assumes whatever form he likes." "He (The Para Brahman) is itself Bliss. Having attained that Para Brahman this Muktha becomes endowed with joy, when he attains the Brahman." "भगवान् (who is आनन्दमय is said to be the source of Bliss for others. (i.e. the individual souls)."

## 15 साक्षी
He who sees them all directly. Bhagaवाn is known as "साक्षी" (witness) because He directly sees the मुक्ताs enjoy the Bliss He has bestowed and he is also happy seeing them full of joy. The suffix 'in' is added to the root according to a grammatical rule to form a noun to show that the person is direct eye-witness to a particular act. The object of attainment by the Muktha, viz,. "Brahman, the Omniscient". Omniscience is explained as knowledge capable of cognising all things of varied nature.

## 16 क्षेत्रज्ञः
The knower of the field for action. Bhagavan is called क्षेत्रज्ञः because he knows the extreamely suitable place for conferring on the Released Souls in this way the joy of enjoying Him. The suffix 'ka' is added to the root 'ज्ञ' (to know) in the word क्षेthrajnah according to the grammatical rule which says. "The suffix 'ka' is added to a root which ends in 'आ' (likeज्ञ), when it is not preceded by a preposition and the final 'आ' of the root is dropped." The parama-vyओma, i.e. vaikuntta is referred to here as क्षेत्र (field) because it is the place which yields the crop of Bliss in plenty. or 'क्षेत्र' may mean the body of bhagaवाn itself possessed of a similar quality. The Vedic Manthra proclaims "Brahman has आकाश (i.e. vaikuntta) as its body. " In Narayaण्य (महाभारत) the goal of attainment by the muktha, i.e. परमात्म, is specified as the क्षेत्रज्ञ in the following Slओka." "Oh Brahma! The goal of attainment for the mukthas is specified as the क्षेत्रज्ञ ." That again is the place where the मुक्ताs enjoy भगवान् . "He (the muktha) enjoys (भगवान् ) in Parama-व्योम , i.e., vaikuntta." "The greatness (in the form of enjoying भगवान् ) is obtained by the muktha in श्री vaikuntta." "He (the muktha) shines in श्री Vaikuntta" "He (the muktha) enjoys Bliss in Vaikuntta" Here is a Manthra which expresses the wish of a muktha who does not want rebirth in this world. "When compared with the eternal Viakuntta (Parama-आकाश ) this आकाश (Ether) adorned with flower - like stars is without lustre like night. I go to vaikuntta and begin to live there. May I not have rebirth." "That is the supreme Abode of Mine, after reaching which they (the Rel- eased Souls) do not come back." In the मोक्षधर्म , it is said:- when the soul gets rid of the fear of old age and death, he becomes endowed with the auspicious qualities mentioned in the authoritative texts viz. Vedas and आगमा, and he becomes freed from the cause (i.e.Karma) and its fruit (i.e. the body). The आकाश he reaches (i.e. vaikuntta is without the name and form of the ordinary world and he rem- ains there without a body (like the one in the material world). In the विष्णु पुराण- "Those yogins who are exclusively devoted to Brahman and who are engaged in its meditation, reach a supreme place which the सुरी-s (Eternal Angels) are always seeing (i.e. enjoying)." In the Brahma पुराण much is said about श्री vaikuntta. It begins with these words: That is called 'Parama-Vyओma' (i.e.Supreme आकाश or श्री वैकुण्ठ ) about which it is said that there is nothing in it (like those that are seen in this world)." Then it continues "The undisputed conclusion is that it is the place known as मोक्ष " (Salvation) and that it is the place of Supreme Effulgence which belongs to विष्णु In the वराह पुराण भगवान् says to sage Agasthya, " See this world which exists for My sake and which is not seen even by the Vedas. O best of Brahmins! This world has been shown to you in order to please you." Agasthya says in the वराह पुराण - "O Lord the world that pertains to you is the best and the noblest of all worlds. O Sage, I have seen all the worlds of Brahma, Indra and others. Oh best of as- cetics! It appears to me that this is a unique world. It is replete with wealth and riches and radiance as well as gem-set storeys of palaces. O Sage engaged in the practice of severe austerities!. I am even now steeped in the meditation on that supreme world. When am I going to reach that best and noblest of all worlds? This is the thought that is ever haunting me", and so on. In Rigvidhi it is stated- "They say that this Supreme Abode is the primary cause of all effects, the highest objective of all words and the ultimate object of realisation of the योगा-s." Sage Dhaumya speaks in the आरण्य पर्वं very highly about that place and says "The Supreme Lord, नारायण, is the Deity without beginning or end, and He is said to be the eternal cause of the Primordial matter from which all beings emerge. His supreme world is far more effulgent than the world of Brahma." "O Bharatha (Yudhishttira!) The souls after reaching it do not return to this world. O King! This place is firm, imperishable and indestructible. "युधिष्ठिर ! Bow before this world which pertains to the Lord always. In the Harivamsa in the episode in which the sons of a pious Brahmin are carried away and are brought back by भगवान् , who Himself says: - "The best of Bharathas! (Arjuna) ; You have seen that celestical world of wonder, full of Brahmic effulgence. I am He (whom you saw there) and that is the effulgence of Mine which is eternal. That is my supreme Prakruthi (or Transcendent Nature) which is both Vyaktha and Avyaktha (manifest to the devotee) and unmanifest ( to the impious). O Best भारताs (Arjuna)! The Souls (जीवाs) enter this Prakruthi and they become mukthas (Released Souls), O पार्था! (Arjuna); It is the goal for the सांख्याs (i.e. those who meditate upon the जीवा for its realisation) and for the योगिने-s addicted to penance. The entire Universe which wishes to attain it resorts with devotion to that supreme Bra- hman." The reputed Brahma Samhitha narrates the serial order of the तत्वाs and says. "Paramaपुरुष resides in the heart-lotus and He is multifaced. He is omniscient, all pervading, and is Himself all things, He stands enveloping all things. The pure and subtle आकाश (श्री वैकुण्ठ ) shines with His effulgence. That Transce- ndent world (paramapada) is like pure crystal and replete with joy. Those who have realised the तत्वा-s (rishis) attain this world and are freed from the touch of things both auspicious and inauspicious (i.e. पुणय and पाप). They are of the size of a त्रसरेणु (i.e. a particle of dust composed of three atoms) and are adorned by millions of rays. Neither do they take birth in this world, nor do they die." All this is well-known from passages like these- In this Paramapada, there is a city which goes by the name of 'अयोद्ध्य' and 'अपराजिता'. There is a Palatial mansion 'अपराजितम्' (Invincible) by name. There is a Hall of celestial beauty supported by thousand pillars etc. In it is a couch on which the Lord along with लक्षमी is to be meditated upon as the object of enjoyment for the numberless Released Souls. All this is well-known from the छन्दयोग , तैत्तिरीय, Kaushithaki and other Upanishads.

## 17 अक्षरः
He who never wanes. He is calles अक्षरः because He never becomes less; nut as the object of enjoyment He ever grows more and more like a stream of honey in spite of His being enjoyed by the मुक्ताs at all times there. Such is the manifestation of His unlimited qualities. The suffix 'ach' is added to the verb 'क्षरति' according to the grammatical rule that the suffix 'ach' should be added after 'pachathi' and other verbs. The names 'विकर्मः' (79) and 'Suranandah' (188) are words ending with the suffix 'ach'. "परमपुरुष is unsullied even though He is attained and enjoyed (by other i.e. मुक्ताs). Since, He does not owe His greatness to others and since He is great by Himself, His supreme nature never diminishes." In the शारीरक (i.e. Brahma सुत्रा-s) in the fourth chapter मोक्ष has been affi- rmed to be of this kind. This chapter cannot be interpreted as delineating fruits of a lower order. In that case the earlier three chapters which deal with the means of attaining Salvation, the Upanishadic texts which have been quoted as authority, and Smruthi, Ithihasa and other Scriptures also will have to be taken as dealing with those fruits of a lower order, and all of them will become शास्त्र that have nothing to do with the मोक्ष. Thus, भगवान् is the Supreme Goal of attainment for the मुक्ता-s.

## 18 योगः
He who is the Means It is stated that, this भगवान् alone is the natural and independent means for salvation. The word योग is derived fromt he verb 'Yujyathe' which means 'With whose help the goal is attained.' The suffix 'ghajn' is added to form a noun by the rule-'ghajn' is added which signifies any case exc- epting the nominative-case." The names 'मार्गः' (367,399) (161) and others have been derived by the addition of the suffix 'ghajn'. The meaning of the word 'योग' is that He is the immediate cause of Salvation and does not stand in need of the help of anything else. "This (भगवान् ) alone confers joy". "It is declared in the वेदा-s that He is the cause (for the bliss of जीva)." "I shall set you free from all sins."

## 19 योगविदां
नेता He who leads those who practice yoga भगवान् leads to salvation even those who adopt the means that are not direct. 'Thrich' is the suffix that has been added to 'नयति' from whichverb the name नेता is derived. भारता (33) धाता (43,951) and other names also have been formed with the suffix 'thrich' at the end. भनवान् carries on the task undertaken till the fruit is attained. "In order to bless them (I dispel their ignorance)" "I lift them up (from the ocean of संसार which is frightful like death)" "Hari alone ought to be propitiated by those who wish to cross the va st ocean of संसार" "Having attained the Eternal भगवान् , they all become freed (from संसार)." "Then the Muktha becomes the object of favour for the Paramathma and attains immortality.

## 20 प्रधानपुरुषेश्वरः
The lord of Primordial Matter and Purushah. भगवान् is the Master in every way of the Primordial Matter and जीवाs (आत्मा ) - प्रधान, which is the cause of bondage, and जीवाs, who are the souls bound by it. The suffix 'varach' is added to the roots 'स्था' (is) 'भाs' (shiine) 'ईश ' (to rule); and thereby the name "ईश्वर " is formed. The name स्थावर (428) also comes under this class. "(भगवान्) the ruler maintains this universe in which the changing Prakruthi and the unchanging जीवa are united and which again is composed of matter, subtle and gross. The जीव who is not a master himself is kept under bondage and experiences (the fruit of his action. When he realises the Lord, he is freed from all bonds). "भगवान् the master of Primordial Matter and आत्म as well as the Lord of all qualities." "That One Deity controls the क्षार (Primordial Matter) and the जीवात्म." In this way the Supreme Master (भगवान् ) has the power to indulge in sport binding with His Maya the erring जीवा-s and setting free (from bondage) those who seek refuge in Him. "The Master of all beings." "This Prakruthi, composed of the three गुणा-s (Saththva, Rajas and Thamas), is mine. I am entertaining Myself, playing with it." "An instrument for play for the sporting Lord." "A toy (the universe is for भगवान्.)" "भगवान् is at once the cause for the bondage, release and sustenance of this world." श्री विष्णु Thaththva declares: "Excepting the Grace of भगवान् there is nothing any where that can bring about the destruction of the माय (i.e. the world) which He Himself has created. This truth we say in brief." Here are two Aphorisms from the Brahma सूत्रा-s to that effect. "It is only by the will of परमपुरुष that the natural form of the जीवा is concealed. Again by His will alone the bondage and its oppposite (i.e. release) of the जीवा are brought about." "This concealment (of the true nature of जीवा ) is caused by the contact with the body (at the time of creation) or by the contact with the Primordial Matter (i.e. prakruthi) (at the time of deluge)." The suffix 'varach' is used to ढow that the quality spoken about is innate and inseparably associated with that person. By its use here, it is shown that the difference among the three Realities (Sentient, Non-Sentient and God) and the state of भगवान् being the ruler and the other two being the ruled are nat- ural and not conditioned by any adventitious cause.

## 21 नरसिंहवपुः
he who is possessed of a body of man and lion combined. भगवान् shows the removal of impediments to devotion to him. He has a huge form of man and lion combined, which He takes at His will, which is celesti- al, which removes the fears of His devotees, and which is assumed the mom- ent the request is made.

## 22 श्रीमान्
He of a lovely form. Though भगवान is taking a form which is unique with head and body not mutually matching and not comely, He is श्रीमान् i.e., His form is celestial and very charming with beauty, loveliness and other qualities. The combination of the forms of man and lion in him is so perfect and appropriate that those who have seen it would almost feel an aversion when they see a simple lion or a man without such combination. The world was indeed protected only by assuming such a unique form. "By the celestial Lord नरसिंह, who assumes a body with frightful jaws, the fear of the gods was dispelled and the world was saved."

## 23 केशवः
he who has lovely locks of hair The name 'Kesava' suggests by implication that the Lord is possessed of qualities like supremacy delineated above and loveliness which are all his own by nature. The meaning of the word is - the Lord who is possessed of curly locks of hair which are sublime, soft and blue. The suffix 'va' is added to the word 'Kesa' by a grammatical rule. To denote the supreme loveliness of the locks of hair.

## 24 पुरुषोत्तमः
The Supreme amongst the invidual souls. The sublime quality that distinguishees परमात्म from other souls is shown by this name lest some should think that there are others equal to Him. The word पुरुष which signifies a sentient being, distinguishes 'परमात्म from पाकृति or Primordial matter which is devoid of knowle- dge and which is in two forms - subtle and gross (i.e. invisible and vi- sible). The part of the word 'uth', in 'uththama', which means 'superior' distinguishes परमात्म had it been used, from the Released Souls (or मुक्ताs). The superlative suffix 'thamap' in the word 'uththama' distinguishes परमात्म from the Eternally free souls like आदिशेष and Garuda. This dist- inction of परमात्मा from all (The forms of them) is because of his sublime superiority which is natural to Him and which is due to His being oppos- ed to all blemishes, His help to all things by pervading and protecting them and by His being the Supreme Master of all. There is mention in the शास्त्राs that there are two kinds of पुरुषs (क्षार-souls in bondage; अक्षरa - Mukthas or Released souls). "Earth, water fire, wind (ether all of which are the forms of Prakruthi, are mine)" "Who realises me as having no birth from beginningless time" "He Who is changeless and pure" "The supreme, the greatest among the great" From these and many other passages it can be seen that परमात्म alone is Supreme. Here also it is clear that there is absolute difference between the enjoyer (जीवात्म ), the object of enjoyment (nonsentient matter) and the Director (परमात्म). Therefore the theory that Brahman itself becomes पुरुष and Prakruthi is refused. There are other theories that Brahman un- dergoes all changes and wallows in the material world (because of Avidya or Nescience, that there is a Brahman other than the ईश्वर (the Supreme ruler), the nonsentient Prakruthi, released Soul and ईश्वर all of them get dissolved in Brahman and emerge from it. If these views are accepted they go against the declaration here about पुरुषोत्त्म and against all the esta- blished doctrines of the वेद..

## 25 सर्वः
He who is all भगवान् is superior to all, and does not depend on anybody for anything. Still He does not neglect any one since, He sustains the forms, the existence and activities of all of them. He considers them as His body even as soul does its own body. So, He is Sarvah--- all. (The root 'sr' in) 'सारथी' has the suffix 'van' in the sense of moving the limbs. 'सारथी' which means 'moves' is to be taken here in the sense of knowing. Here is an etymological interpretation of this name, 'Sarvah'. "They call भगवान् ' सर्व' as He is the cause of creation and destruction of all things that are known as 'असत्' (i.e. अचेतन) and 'सत्' (i.e.चेतन), and as He has the knowledge of all things at all times." It has been declared that the basis for the use of समानाधि करण्य (i.e.co-ordination or grammatical apposition), of all things with परमात्म is this kind of pervasion or relation- ship. The Vedic Text begins by saying. "All things are connected with Him as gems in a thread" and declares "He is verily all this." "Thou pervadest all things. Therefore Thou art Sarva, (all)."

## 26 शर्वः
The remover भगवान् known as 'Sarva' because He removes the evils of all objects that are His body. The suffix 'van' is added to the root 'sr' according to the rule mentioned above.

## 27 शिवः
He who confers auspiciousness He is Siva as He confers auspiciousness on all. The word "Siva" is dervied from the root 'Seeing' which signifies auspiciousness. The suffix 'van' is added according to the rule "Sarva" nighrshva. Siva. The grammatical rule lays down that the long vowel 'ई' of the root is shortened to 'I' and it does not undergo the change called 'गुण'. "The Eternal, The Auspicious and Never-deserting." "When He is remembered, the devotee becomes the abode of all auspiciousness." "Lord विषणु is auspiciousness incarnate". "Hari is the abode of all auspiciousness." "He is the cause of auspiciousness in all things that are auspicious." "विष्णु who is Himself auspicious and is the object of our auspicious acts."

## 28 स्थाणुः
He who is firm in blessing thers In bestowing auspiciousness, He is firm. The affix 'nu' is added to 'स्था' (तिष्टति) signifying steadiness in blessing others. The result of the contact with भगवान् does not stop with the destruction of some particular sins as ordinary acts of expiation do, nor does it get exhausted by the granting of only a particular fruit (desired) like करीरि, Chithra, दर्सपूर्णमास and other sacrifies or like the worship of other minor deities, nor obstructed by powerful impediments, nor reduced in degree, nor is it destroyed. Not only does it completely destroy the inauspiciousness in a devotee, but also fulfils all his desires in many ways. Even then it does not stop with it (but is ready to grant more). The one (भगवान् ) who fulfils the desires of many (जीवाs)." "Whoever realises this Brahman that is indestructible, he gets whatever he desires." "When He is pleased, what is there which is unattainable by a devotee?" "विष्णु, indeed, grants all the fruits ( desired)". "O Sage! Just as a person who, though reaching a mountain of gems, gathers gems only according to his capacity (and not all), similarly one gets his desire from कृष्ण in accordance with the quality of saththva in him." "When भगवान् विष्णु is pleased by worship, one gets the fulfilment of all one's desires in this world, attains Svarga and a status where he is honoured by all the denizens of Svarga, and also gets Salvation which is (normally) very difficult to obtain." "मधुसूदन, when meditated upon, gives to his devotee unasked, that which is difficult to get, which is impossible to obtain and which is beyond the comprehension of the mind."

## 29 भूतादिः
He who is eagerly resorted to by all Moreover, He is eagerly sought after by all because He is most desirable. So He is called 'भूतादिः' The Suffix 'Ki' is added by the grammatical rule- The vowel 'आ' in the root 'दा' of the verbal form ' उपाधीयते ' is dropped. The names 'सर्वाधिः' (100) 'Nidhin' (30) and such others also have this 'ki' suffix. 'If we do not have this परमात्म for us, what are we going to do with progeny." This is explained by the texts like the following: "When He is there as our ruler, we may take it that all our great desires have been completely fulfilled."

## 30 निधिः
अव्ययः The inexhaustible treasure He has got to be kept secure with great cupidity like wealth which is safely kept to be used in times of distress. Vide- "He is like a treasure of gold kept concealed underground." "The word 'Avyaya' signifies that He, the Treasure, is inexhaustible and does not get diminished even to the smallest extent even though He may be used at all times and in all ways. The word 'Avyaya' here is an adjective that qualifies 'Nidhi' and not a separate name. Otherwise the names "अव्ययः पुरुषः" (14,15) will be pleonasm (i.e. redundancy of expression).

## 31 सम्भवः
He who manifests Himself. Even though He is like a treasure hidden, He shows Himself to those who long for Him with a great desire to embrace Him. समन्थात् bhavah asya - in all places and at all times, then and there, He manifests Himself innumerable forms as Mathsya, Ku:rma, वराह, Narasimha, वामन, राम, कृष्ण, and others. Sometimes these are also repeated. The Sruthis (गीता and other texts), say. "He takes birth in many forms." " Many are the births I have taken." "Whenever there is a decline of Dharma, (I create Myself.")

## 32 भावनः
Savior . Having taken births like this, He regenerates all by dispelling their evils. As declared in गीत and other texts- "For the protection of the good (do I take birth)."

## 33 भर्ता
Supporter. Moreover He nourishes them by giving Himself up to His devotees as though doing like that is His nature.

## 34 प्रभवः
He of exalted birth. He is Prabhava, because His birth is of a sublime nature. The sublimity of His birth consists in its being unsullied even by the shadow of a blemish; and it is capable of uprooting the fetters of all births of those who realise it; thus it is entirely different from the birth of other gods. Here are the relevant texts. "He is unborn." "Learned men know the ( cause of ) His birth very well." "He was not born of any one, nor did He live in the womb of any one. By his power कृष्ण brings about the redemption of all." "Because of his deeds comparable to those of the Supreme Deity, पाण्डव (युधिष्ठिर) concluded that श्री कृष्ण was immeasurable, devoid of beginning and end, unborn, yet born among human beings out of His own free will." "Whoever understands properly the celestial nature of my birth and acts, He comes to me, O Arjuna! When he gives up his body."

## 35 प्रभुः
He who is all powerful. Though He comes down as a man who is or some other being which is absolutely dependent on others. He is still Prabhuh (most powerful). The affix 'du' has been added to the root 'भू' with the preposition 'pra'; and the word 'Prabhu' is a proper name. This is an exception to the rule that the affix 'du' cannot be added to signify a name. He is capable of bestowing fruits like the enjoyment of the pleasures of the rare posts of the gods and others as well, as even मोक्ष . This is clear from the fact that Salvation was conferred even upon Sisuपाla (who always abused Him) and Chinthayanthi (Gओpi who was a great devotee of श्री कृष्ण).

## 36 ईश्वरः
The supreme Ruler. He is known as ईश्वर because of Supreme power of Control which is more useful in his incarnations than even in परमपद. Vide गीता -- "They are ignorant of my Supreme power which persists even when I have taken a human body." "Even when I take birth I am born keeping the power of ruling over all beings."

## 37 स्वयंभूः
He who manifests Himself Whence is all this greatness? Because He is Svayambhu:h maniferting Himself. The affix 'kvip' comes after 'bhu:' when the word so formed denotes a name or surety. For the purpose of His sport (लीला) He, out of His own free will, with His Prakruthi (or essential nature) which is exclusively His and which is of the quality of pure saththva, assumes and permeates the forms similar to those of gods and men. Unlike in the case of the four-faced Brahma and others, who are not independent' His birth is not controlled by any other god or by Karma. "For the sake of His devotees supreme Brahman manifests itself ( Svayambhu)." "I get into my own Prakruthi (composed of Suddhasaththva) and am born by my own will." Though the two Prakruths, the one composed of the three qualities (Saththva, रजस् and तमस् ) and the other the sentient, belong to Him, still this Prakruthi (i.e.suddha saththva is specifically, referred to as "My own Prakruthi" because it belongs exclusively to Him and is the world of enjoyment. In the Harivamsa in the episode of bringing back the sons of the Vaidik Brahman from श्री वैकुण्ठ, He refers to the two Prakruthis ( Chethana and Achethana) which are the instruments for His sport, and continues. "You have seen the splendour of Brahman which is celestial and wonderful. O Best of Bharathas! I am that; and that is my splendour and it is eternal. Bharatha! That Prakruthi of mine is superior and it is of two kinds, gross and subtle (visible and invisible). O the greatest amongst भारताs! Once the souls enter into it, they become मुक्ताs(i.e. free from the cycle of birth and death). It is clearly mentioned in श्री विष्णु Thaththva after mentioning the five sakthis:-- (Five sakthis are the five forms of भगवान् , Para, Vyuha etc. "The manifestations of the Supreme Being as Mathsya (Fish), कूर्म (Tortoise) and वराह (Boar) are composed of this effulgent substance ( known as Suddha Saththva) and not of any other substance which is not like it and so counter to it, O Best of Brahmins!" विष्णु पुराण refers to the five forms of भगवान् , as "All these five sagthis" by which it is indicated that they are all of them unique and superior because of the nature of their manifestation, purpose, cause, source, time, number and other things. fc In रामायणा it is said:- "The Supreme Lord of all worlds Himself (brought about the end of the राक्षसाs) with a desire to do good to the world." "Being requested by the gods who wanted the end of the proud रावण, विष्णु, the eternal Lord, took birth in this world of mortals." "He manifested by Himself and shone."

## 38 शम्भूः
The source of happiness. : The Source of happiness. He is 'शम्भूः ' because He causes 'sam' (Happiness) to all by manifesting thus His beauty, availability and other qualities. In the section dealing with 'du' suffix, that suffix is added to words like 'mithadru' according to a grammatical rule. Vide "He visualises all things directly", He is the cause of Bliss for all beings." This has been explained by the following स्तोकs in the रामायण "श्री राम attracts the eyes and the hearts of men by His beauty, generosity and similar qualities." "राम who has a face lovelier than the moon, and who has an extremely pleasing appearance."

## 39 आदित्यः
The person in the Sun. Next the पुरुष in the Sun is given as an example for the manifestation or incarnation. आदित्य (Sun) is the abiding place for Him. The affix 'nya' comes after the proper names दिति,अदिति and आदित्य. It has been established thus in the Brahma सुत्र "He who is seen in the interior of the Sun is the supreme Brahman, because the qualities that are mentioned in that context pertain only to Brahman." "The lovely resplendent पुरुष who is seen in the interior of the Sun." "He, is only the same (Deity) who is seen in the heart of a human being and who is seen in the Sun." "He must always be meditated upon who is in the middle of the orb of the Sun." This passage is quoted and the Upanishad says with reference to Him who is in the interior of the Sun that "His two eyes are like the lotus flower that has been blossomed by the Sun."

## 40 पुष्कराक्षः
The Lotus-eyed. The Name पुष्कराक्ष associates भगवान् with the possession of lotus eyes which is a specific indication that He is the Sole ruler of the entire universe. This is a compound word ending with the 'ach' suffix according to a grammitical rule that the word 'Akshi' will take the 'ach' suffix when it does not mean "vision."

## 41 महास्वनः
He of venrable sound This name indicates another distinctive mark of His. महान् means venerable and Svanah means, sound, i.e. possessed of venerable sound. The final vowel 'a' of the word 'mahath' is replaced by long 'आ' in a compound where both the words are in the same case (i.e. in apposition). "His name is 'uth' ( He who is above foibles)." The name and form of this (Supreme Being) have as their basis, sound (i.e. the वेदाs). "He is indeed the three वेदाs. He is the charming पुरुष shining in the interior of the Sun." Thus, His form is the three वेदाs themselves; or He is the Supreme object of worship, since, He is signified by the सावित्री (i.e. गायत्री ). Therefore it is mentioned in the मोक्ष Dharma about भगवान् as follows: "I am the Eternal पुरुष who is in the Solar Orb and who is closely associated with Vidya".

## 42 अनादिनिधनः
One who is without beginning or end With such a celestial name and form He is without beginning or end. Since His youthfulness is eternal. He is possessed of a body which is eternal, and which is devoid of the foibles of birth, old age and the like. This should not be interpreted as signifying the eternity of His essential nature, because that is the same in the case of the four-faced Brahma and others also. "He has a resplendent form and has the power of making all that he wills come out true." "He is the enchanting पुरुष ." "Out of the sparkling पुरुष (sprang all objects)." "He is of the radiance of the Sun and is beyond the region of तमस् (i.e. Prakruthi, Mortal world). "He has all the worlds which are His creation, and endowed with all fragrance and with all tastes." "The Supreme पुरुष is to be meditated upon as having the lustre of gold and reached by a knowledge which is unaffected by external forces and which can be compared to the undisturbed dream (of a man)." "पुरुष who is lotus-eyed." There are thousands of Sruthis and Smrithis like those quoted above which establish that the Lord has a body which He assumes out of His own free will, which is like a blue cloud in the midst of sparking rows of lightnings, which is spotless, blue and shining, and which is endowed with lovable qualities like Supreme loveliness, beauty and youthfulness. It is further stated with reference to this form of परमात्म as follows: "He is possessed of a body which is always in the same state and immutable." "He has the mole named श्रीवत्स on His chest and is endowed with ever-lasting beauty." Sage पराशर says "This भगवान् is Time itself and keeps all things under His control." "There is no Thaththva (Reality) superior to विष्णु and his body is beyond the sway of time." By these and other such clear declarations the fact is beyond dispute that the body of the Lord is eternal. The reasons for the same areIt pertains to भगवान् who is always the cause; it is also one of the attributes like knowledge etc. which define His essential nature ( स्वरूप ); it exists beyond the Prakruthi which is called Thamas; it is beyond the region of mutations like birth and the like it is specifically stated that it is immutable and is beyond the sway of time; and also by the तत्-क्रतु maxim (i.e. the theory that the result is in the same proportion as the means). The devotee attains the blissful experience of the body of भगवान् which is similar to the one on which he meditates here. Such is the strength of the scriptures (आगमाs) and reasons about the nature of the form of the Supreme Being. Contrary to this, no theory based on inferences can be put forward which will try to set up a body which is imaginary or new ( and not eternal). Therefore texts, which seem to declare परमात्म as formless, must be taken to mean that He has no body which is like that of the mortals or which is despicable. In fact, शास्त्रिक् texts like the following give the same interpretation:-- "The body of परमात्म is not made up of the combination of elements like earth, water etc." "His form is not composed of earthly elements like fat, flesh and bone." In the wake of भद्रायण (the author of the Brahma सूत्रs), the commentators (वाक्याकर and भाष्यकर) also have propounded that the form of the Supreme ब्राह्मन in the interior of the Sun is eternal. "His body is beyond the range of the sense-organs for it is stated that it can be cognised only by the eye of the mind." "Truly the body of the creator of the universes is eternal." Even the Incarnations of the Lord have no beginning or end unlike the bodies of the worldly beings. But it is only a case of exit from and entry into the Paramapada like an actor coming on the stage from behind the curtain and then disappearing by going away. "This, my unique body, is endowed with four arms and is in that celestial Abode. O Gods! Worship the inscrutable body of mine which has come to the human world. I live in it for ever." "O Supreme God! The world has been freed from all distress. Come to the Heavens which is for all times protected and which is devoid of all defects and sins." "He entered the world of Lustre of विष्णु with His own body and with His followers." Such, indeed, is the secret guarded by the sages.

## 43 धाता
The Creator This name signifies the glory of भगवान् which is superior to that of Brahma and others, because of His being the cause of all things, The world ends with the affix 'trn' 'भरता' (33) and other words also are like this. The name धाता signifies that भगवान् , in the form of Aniruddha, places Brahma the foetus who is the aggregate of sentient beings, in Prakruthi, which is the cause of all and which is the aggregate of non-sentient objects. "The great Brahman (i.e.Prakruthi) is my womb and I impregnate it." In the Maula Samhitha it is stated-- "धाता places in the क्षेत्र (i.e.Prakruthi the foetus (i.e.जीव) which is the seed for actions." "First He created the waters; and in them (In the aggregate state of Prakruthi ), he put in His vigour (the sentient aggregate)"

## 44 विधाता
The Producer भगवान् is called विधाता because He develops the foetus and makes it appear." "From Him, विराट् (i.e. Brahma ) was born." "There in was born Brahma Himself who is known as the grand sire of the universe." From these and other texts the fact mentioned above (can be known as being correct).

## 45 धातुरुत्तमः
Far Superior to Brahma Therefore भगवान् is far superior to the creator. From this it goes without saying that He is superior to (Daksha and other) Prajapathis who are created by that Brahma, on the analogy of the maxim of Danda and अपूप . Danda-अपूप -न्याय - The maxim of the stick and the cakes. When a stick (to drive away the rats) and the cakes have been kept together, and one says that the stick has been eaten away by the rats', we are naturally led to expect that the cakes also would have been eaten away by those rats, as a matter, of course, since both of them have been kept together. So when one thing is closely connected with another in some way and we say something of the one, it naturally follows that what we assert about the one can, as a matter of course, be asserted of the other also. If it is stated that विष्णु is greater than Brahma, who creates the प्रजापतिs, it naturally follows that He is greater than those प्रजापतिs also who were created by Brahma). "नारायण is the Supreme Thaththva (Reality)." "The question was put "Who is the Highest Deity amongst all these gods?" And the reply was "नारायण is the Supreme God and from him was born the four-faced Brahma." The same is clear from the dialogue between Brahma and अdra and from the Yagjna-agra-हरण (Chapter on the order of precedence in honouring the gods and the priests in a sacrifice).

## 46 अप्रमेयः
The immesurable भगवान् is immeasurable by the sense - organs of those Brahma and other gods. "When the 'आ' of a root like ('प्रमा'') is followed by 'yath' , it takes 'ई' affix," "Brahma himself declares --- "We do not verily know the beginning , middle and end of the birthless Supreme Creator (विष्णु ) whose forms all things are. We neither know the essential nature of the Supreme ruler; nor this sublime greatness, nor His power." Again in the dialogue between Brahma and rudra we come across statements like the following:- " O greatest beings! It is impossible for you, for me or for others to visualize Him. He is the cosmos itself. Whether He is taken as possessed of (auspicious) qualities or as bereft of all (bad) qualities, He is ever spoken of as being cognised only by knowledge." "He is the Inner Soul of yourself and myself and also of all who go by the name of आत्माs (embodied souls). He sees everything directly in person, but He cannot be realized by anyone anywhere." From these texts it is clear that He is immeasurable because He is beyond the region of the sense-organs and He cannot be cognised by anyone in full.

## 47 हृषीकेशः
The controller of the sense-organs भगवान् is called हृषीकेश because He controls the sense-organs of those organs of those gods also. In Harivamsa it is stated "They say that हृषीकस् are sense-organs. Since your are their controller, you are known as हृषीकेश. Amongst the gods, विष्णु is known as केशव." Or "He gets the name of हृषीकेश because of joy (हर्ष ) happiness (Saukhya) and effortless rulership (Sukhaisvarya)." (हृषी + Ka +एsa).

## 48 पद्मनाभः
He who has a lotus in the naval The name पद्मनाभः substantiates all that has been stated above about भगवान्. He is the cause of Brahma (the lotus - born). He has a lotus in His navel. "The affix 'ach' is to be added to Saman and laman when 'prathi' 'anu' or, 'ava' precede them and also before all compounds. The latter we get by dividing the सूत्र into two parts. "The Supreme Creator (भगवान् ) lying on his back with face upwards sleeps for five hundred years." "From the navel of the Supreme Creator a lotus emerges, The lotus which is like a circle is also known as Pushkara and पुण्डरीक. Chakra (the Discus) is Time." "In the navel of the Birthless भगवान्, a unique substance is stationed." "In the navel of the Birthless भगवान् there is one substance (a lotus), in which the entire Universe is contained ( at the time of delusion)." Such other texts also.

## 49 अमरप्रभूः
The powerful Lord of the immortal gods भगवान् is Amara-Prabhu, because , He bestows on those gods the duty of creation etc., and also directs them. Brahma himself says in the रामायण --- "You were lying on the waters of the great ocean and you first of all created me. The entire duty of the प्रजापति (the rulership of the beings ) was entrusted to me by you." In the महाभारत it is said "These two great gods (Brahma and rudra) are said to have emerged from the sweet temper and wrath of भगवान् (respectively). They carry out the duty of creation and destruction in the way shown by Him." Such other texts.

## 50 विश्वकर्मा
He who is the agent of all actions (in regard to the universe) All the entire work (visvam karma) with regard to the affairs of the universe both before and after the creation of Brahma is His alone. "This universe became dissolved in भगवान् who is the creator of all." "पुरुष to whom do pertain all the acts of the universe, who is the first Deity, who is birthless and who is all pervasive." All this can be clearly seen in the Visvakarma-सुक्त which begins with the Manthra - "He who offered all these worlds" as oblation in His own body. (i.e. All these worlds in their subtle form were in His body.) "Sath, (the Para Brahman) Willed, "I shall become many. I shall take birth." "He willed, I shall create the worlds." "He willed, I shall become many, I shall take birth." "Then नारायण thought in his mind about another desire (Creation of the world a new)." "Brahman which was in a subtle form before creation) made up its mind to become (many in gross form)." "Brahman desired to create different kinds of beings out of its body and so it willed." "भगवान् with a desire to create, produced the पुरुष in two forms ( विराट् पुरुष and हिरण्यगर्भ) out of a thousandth part of Himself." "भगवान् creates by His mere will and He does not look for the help of the non-sentient Prakruthi."

## 51 मनुः
He who wills The creation of the cosmos was only out of a minute part of His will that is reputed. He is 'Manu' because He thinks or wills. 'Manu' is derived from the root 'man' (to think or know). The affix 'u' comes after the root 'man' (to know) and the word 'Manu' is formed.

## 52 त्वष्टा
The chiseller. The world that has been created by Him thus is invested with name and form and the distinction as god, man, etc. is brought about in diverse forms and so He is called 'त्वष्टा' (the chiseller). The word is derived from the verb 'त्वक्षतिi' which signifies the act of chiselling. The suffix 'trch' is added. "The 's' or 'k' when -initial in a conjunct consonant, is dropped before a 'Jhal' affix and at the end of a word." So the 'k' in 'त्वक्षतिi' is dropped. Chiselling means investing an object with a definite shape. Or the word त्वष्टा can be derived from the root 'thvish' to shine. The affix 'Thrn' and the change of the penultimate vowel 'I' (in Thvish) to 'a' are prescribed by a grammatical rule. Or when the root 'thvish' is used to denote a deity, the penultimate letter 'I' is changed into 'a'. The word दीपानाम् signifies illuminating. i.e.developing the limbs. "Thvashta, who is omniscient and who fashions the forms and (names of the objects of the world)." "The creator of the World ( परमात्म ) produced the objects of two kinds (Sath and Asath i.e. sentient and non-sentient with the help of the वेद." "The omniscient (परमपुरुष) having created the multitudinous forms (gave the forms and names)" "He brought about the forms and names of the beings and also their respective duties." And such other texts.

## 53 स्थाविष्ठः
He who is exceedingly huge in size The affix 'ishttan' has been added to the word 'स्थूल'. By a grammtical rule the letter 'la' in word 'स्थूल' is dropped and the previous vowel 'ऊ' takes the 'gua' (substitute) (i.e.becomes 'av'); and hence the word ' स्थविष्ठ'. 'I shall become many' is the infallible will of भगवान्. In consonance with this, He expanded Himself. From the aggregate state which is undeveloped and subtle, He took the expanded form as bodies and senses of the experiencing god, man, animal and plant-life, as the sound touch and other qualities that are the objects of their sense-organs, as the भ्रहमांण्ड (the egg-like universe) pregnant with the fourteen worlds which are the places of residence for all those beings, as well as its sheath, and again as the individual effects which are in a gross and developed state. Thus He manifests Himself. Here are the texts in support of this theory. "There is no end to my expansion."(Githa). "He who has expanded Himself in the forms of ether) Water, air, fire and earth, and who is more atomic in size (i.e. more subtle than the atom itself." "All this universe is the expansion of विष्णुu Who is all things by Himself. "O Lord, thy expansion is, verely all this."

## 54 स्थाविरः
He who is existent at all times This name proceeds to signify that despite His being the original cause of all, still भगवान् is different from the mud and other such causes in the world. The word 'Sthavira' is formed by a grammatical rule which decrees that the root 'stha' (तिष्टति) to stand takes the affix 'Kirach' the long vowel 'आ' (in स्था) becomes the short 'a' and a new letter 'vuk' is added. The meaning is He exists at all times. Though for His sport ( namely the creation etc. of the world) He accepts the help of Time. He is not bound by it. By this it is indicated that His nature is entirely different from that of milk etc. which stand in need of some time turn into curd etc. That is because Time is entirely under His control, vide. "भगवान् alone controls Time, Death, and the moving and non-moving things (in the word)." This is the truth. I tell you." "केशव by His Sankalpa (will) is always turning the wheel of Time, the wheel of the universe and the wheel of the ages." "There (in श्री Vaikuntta) भगवान् manipulates the Time as He likes. Verily Time is powerless there." And other such texts also.

## 55 ध्रुवः
He who is firm and unchanging. He is Dhruvah, because His essential nature does not undergo any change. Though there are endless transformations, He is always immutable. The root 'dhru' signifies both gathi (movement) and sthairya (firmness) : The affix 'ka' is added to the root by a grammatical rule. Similarly the names Guhah (365), विषः (314), निमिषः (215) and others have been formed with the affix 'ka'. "He who is invincible, eternal and unchanging." "He who is immutable and pure." "He who is bereft of decay and death."

## 56 अग्राह्यः
One who is beyond the grasp of others Unlike the mud, thread and other things which are controlled and acted upon by a potter, a weaver and others,भगवान् is not controlled by any one अग्राह्य The affix 'nyath' has been added to the word in the end according to the grammatical rule The suffix 'nyath' comes after a verb that ends with the vowel 'r' long or short or in a consonant. The names वेद्यः (165),मान्यः (755) and the like have been formed similarly. "One could grasp Him neither at the top, nor across, nor in the middle. (top in the form of non-sentient things like pillars acrossin the form of animals; middle - in the form of human beings). "The Supreme Brahman controlled." "He alone controlled all things."

## 57 शाश्वतः
The eternal He is शाश्वत (Eternal) because of the continuous flow of action pertaining to the world (i.e.its creation etc.) "These actions of His, viz. The creation, sustenance and destruction of things are going on uninterruptedly."

## 58 कृष्णः
He who is exceedingly delighted. He is called 'कृष्ण' since He is exceedingly happy with the joy of this kind of sport(लील ). Here is an archaic etymological interpretation of the word कृष्ण. "The word 'कृषि" signifies the ground or receptacle and the letters 'णाह' signify joy. He is कृष्ण since He is the receptacle of all joy."

## 59 लोहिताक्षः
The Red eyed He has eyes, red like the beautiful lotus, indicative of the excessive joy that is His.

## 60 प्रतर्दनः
The destroyer. The name signifies that He is the Destroyer of all. The root 'Thardih' means to cause destruction, Vide-"He who has for His food the Brआhmins and the क्षत्रियs (i.e. all the beings of the universe)." "The Supreme ब्राह्मन is the great consumer, since He draws within Himself the entire universe consisting of substances moving and non-moving."

## 61 प्रभूतः
He who is affluent. He is प्रभूतः (rich) though He brings about the destruction of all; because He has the eternal and immeasurable paramapada (the Transcendental world) which is the means of Bliss to Him.

## 62 त्रिकुद्धाम
He who has the three-fold world as His abode This name makes it clear that this world which is subject to creation and destruction is but a small atom when compared with that Paramapada. According to some Thri-kakub-धामा is the reading. In both cases the word Kakuth or kakub signifies parts. He is called Thrikakuth - धामा, because He has the Transcendental World as His supreme abode which is thrice the size (of this world). Vide the Sruthi-"All the things in this world are but an one-fourth part; the eternal Paramapada is three times as big as this. " The word 'Thripआd' is interpreted as being extremely large in size and 'पाद ' as small as on atom. "The extent of this world is but a hundred millionth part of His (form)" "This world is just an atom (when compared with Paramapada) which is as huge as मेरु Mountain." Or the word 'Thrikakuth' may be taken to indicate the six qualities, knowledge and others, which are divided into three groups, two in each. He is their repository, i.e. He is endowed with the six qualities in all their entirety. He is known as 'Thriyugam' because of the possession of the three pairs (of qualities). Or there is also an ancient etymological interpretation, vide Mओkढa Dharma where भगवान् Himself says "Then I assumed the form of a Boar and was with three horns. So I became known as 'Thrikakuth'. With that form I killed the राक्षस." In this case, the meaning is radiance. 'Dharma' is a separate name. Note The six qualities are ज्ञान (intelligence), bala (strength), aisvarya (lordship), वीर्य (valour), Sakthi (ability), and तेजस् (unwearied energy).

## 63 पवित्रं
Purity Incarnate. In this way the qualities, possessions, and body of भगवान् have been portrayed step by step and now we pass on to His essential Nature which is to be cognised by means of these. The affixes 'ithra' and 'uththra' come respectively after the roots 'as', 'thraj' and like these. Or the affix 'ithra' comes after the verb 'पू ' (to purify) in the sense of the 'agent' or the instrument when it is employed in connection with 'ऋषि' which signifies a वेदिक् Manthra or a Deity. (When applied to ऋषि the force is that of an instrument and when applied to a देवत the force is that of an agent.)

## 64 मङगळं
परम् The Embodiment of Supreme Auspiciousness, which is opposed to all that is of the nature of a blemish. The word mangala is derived from the root 'mangi' meaning 'to go' which takes the affix 'alach'. He is the sole resting place of all that is auspicious by virtue of His being self-luminous and blissful. The word 'param' signifies the unlimited nature (of the auspiciousness). That भगवान् has the glory of the continuous enjoyment of qualities and lordship which are innate to Him, endless, limitless and innumerable. It is possible to establish that in His transcendental state he is not wanting in anything and always contented. He is very much like an Ocean of Nectar, waveless and still; but He excels it by the unlimited Bliss resulting from the enjoyment of His own self-luminous Self which is by nature devoid of all blemishes, endless unparalleled and most agreeable. This has been determined by the following Brahma सूत्रा-s. "That which is denoted by the word आनन्द-मया is the Supreme Brahman; because there is the repetition (of various grades of bliss which culminate in the आनन्दमया or the Highest Bliss)." "Bliss and other qualities (are to be included in all meditations) because there is no distinction throughout in regard to the Possessor of the qualities." But there is (in all the विदायाs relating to Brahman) the inclusion of all the qualities, pertaining to the अक्षर i.e. the imperishable Brahman ( because of the sameness of Brahman every where)" It has been declared ( by the Upanishads): "The Brahman is Truth, knowledge and Infinity". "The Brahman is Bliss". "The Supreme is full of tranquility and nectar ( i.e. sweetness)" "When the Supreme Brahman is seen as tranquil, steady and motionless, contented and sweet as nectar, then the mind should be fixed on it for meditation. This is the highest state of meditation." Bliss whose nature is steady, indefinable and indescribable." The Theory that the Supreme Brahman is nothing but intelligence has been refuted in a hundred ways in the work 'Akhanda-khandane." Though भगवान् is endowed with intelligence, bliss, ability, lordship and other qualities, if He is spoken of as intelligence and bliss only, it is because He shines by Himself for Himself in an exceedingly agreeable manner and not because He is either intelligence alone or Bliss alone. A gem, the Sun, and a lamp show the objects on which their rays fall and at the same time they shine by themselves without expecting their help. So they are known as being luminous and also luminaries. In the same way Bhagavँn visualizes all objects by knowledge which is His quality, and without looking for help from them He shines by Himself. And He is known as 'knowledge' and also 'knower'. Or if He is referred to as knowledge it may be on the analogy shown in the Brahma सुत्र. "The denotation ( of the individual self) by the word 'विज्ञान' is due to its having that quality (of विज्ञान' is due to its having that quality (of विज्ञान ) as its essence, as is the case with the Omniscient Lord." Therefore texts like the following do not contradict one another: "He is Truth, knowledge". "He who is omniscient and knows all." In the वर्ष्णेय अध्यात्म speaking about the individual self it is stated: "Just as the individual soul, whether small or big in size remains in a tranquil state of knowledge, in the same way परमपुरुष in all beings must be visualized as knowledge itself. He alone makes others know what is to be known."

## 65 ईशानः
The controller. By this name, भगवान् is distinguished clearly from the bound souls, released souls and ever-free souls whose qualities are shrouded or manifested. "The affix 'चनुस् ' is added to a verb in expressing habit (standard of age and ability)". The word signifies that His innate nature is to keep under control and direct all things under all circumanstances. "That highest and greatest Lord of all Lords." "Intelligence, ability and action which are innate." "There is no one in the world who is His master. No one rules over Him; He has not a sign ( i.e. a body). He is the cause, He is the Lord of him who is the lord of him who is the lord of the senses (i.e. the individual soul); He has no Progenitor and no master." "He is the Lord of all, the controller of all, the ruler of all He does not become greater by means of a good act, nor smaller by a bad one; He is the Lord of all, the king of all beings, the protector of all beings. He is the bridge and support of all the worlds so that they may not get into confusion." "This the supreme Soul, is the ruler of all beings in the universe He is the king of all beings." "There was only one king for the entire universe." "He is the ruler of the universe for ever; and there is no other deity in whom the rulership rests." "The Lord (dwells, O' Arjuna! In the region of the heart) of all embodied beings." "भगवान् alons rules (over the whole universe). This is the truth, I tell you." "परमात्म is the support of all and He is the Supreme ruler." And such other texts. Therefore to those who prattle that the Supreme Being is under the influence of illusion, or of limiting adjuncts, or under goes transmutations, or His over-lordढip omniscience and other qualities are adeventitious, thrice do I offer the oblation of handful of water mixed with seasams ( i.e.I shall consider them as non-existent and shall have nothing to do with them).

## 66 प्राणदः
The life giver. The foremost action resulting from the quality of lordship is denoted by the name प्राणद. He gives life. The affix 'ka' is added to the word. The name signifies that He confers on the Ever-free Angels the strength which will be conducive to visualize Him always, enjoy Him and do service to Him. Vide- "He gives the self and He bestows strength." "The vital airs enter ( the body of a created being) along with the Supreme Divinity."

## 67 प्राणः
Life. He who is also the cause of the redemption of gods He who is also the cause of the redemption of gods. "Thereafter He remained as the unique life of the gods." "(If भगवान् is not there) who can obtain the joy of this world or of the other world?" "प्राण (i.e. भगवान् ) protects this world." "प्राण (Life) is Brahman itself, because it is so understood from the sequel." Here with regard to these two names suitable examples have to be sought after and quoted with care. "Then these gods with immortal lives enter into Him." "Therefore this imperishable Brahman is प्राण (vital air or life) speech and mind." "भगवान् is the source of Bliss like a garden for the eternal Souls (Mukthआs and Nithyआs) and they get this bliss by mere will." "He is mind-made, (i.e. can be attained only by mind) has an effulgent form, He wills the truth." In श्री पौषाकर it is said "Next भगवान् is associated with the celestial instruments which go by the name of five शक्ती-s. Greatly wise one! The five शक्ती-s are Time, knowledge, action, desire and life.प्राण -Sakthi is the Supreme Sould and is endowed with the six qualities. The Supreme God is the eternal lotus - eyed वासुदेव." "O Brahma! Achyutha (i.e. भगवान्) is the group of शक्ती-s named knowledge, Action, Desire and life."

## 68 ज्येषठः
Higly praise-worthy When the word 'प्रशस्य' meaning praise - worthy takes the superlative suffix 'ishttan', the substitute 'jya' takes its place. He is highly praise - worthy because of this sublime glory which can never be fully visualised in spite of its being experienced by Himself and by eternally Free Angels at all times and in all ways. Vide "वासुदाव is the भगवान्; more praise - worthy is His glory." "Brahman alone is the most praise - worthy." Or ज्येष्ठ means "He is the oldest of all beings", since He existed before all of them. "Jya" is also substituted for 'Vruddha' when 'ishtthan' and 'ईyas' affixes follow. In the सभा पर्व (महाभारत) "He is the subtle Prakruthi or Primeval cause and the eternal Agent (Karthँ). He is also greater than all beings. So (भगवान्) Achyutha is considered the oldest."

## 69 श्रेष्ठः
The Pre-eminent. He is always served by the Ever-free Angels by singing His praise as a result of the joy in experiencing Him. 'Jya' is the substitute for 'प्रशस्य' when the superlative affix 'Ishttan' follows. "That is the Supreme Abode of विष्णु where the enlightened souls are ever singing different kinds of praise." The word 'vipanyavah' means those who are ever engaged in eulogy. This praise includes all other kinds of services also. "Thasmai देवा उपासते " - Pious souls who are subordinate to him do service to Him.

## 70 प्रजापतिः
Lord of the Everfree Angels who are they and what is His relationship with them? The answer is given by the word 'Prajapathi'. The Surls (or the Ever-free Angels) are the प्रजा-s (here) who are infinitely superior to the bound souls and freed souls. "The wise souls fall at the feet of Supreme Lord who is Truth Incarnate and who is ever shining as a Ray in the midst or rays." "Him whom the wise Ever-free Angels realise in the depths of the ocean and who is in that great imperishable place." "The free souls reside in Him who is far superior to the Universe." The use of the locative denotes the lordship (अधिरीश्वर). The locative affix 'adhi' is used to signify rulership of the country. The पाञ्चाला-s are in Brahmadaththa. That is to say that Brahmadaththa is the protector of the पाञ्चाला Kingdom. "Who alone is the Supreme Deity among other deities." "In which eternal (Transcendental Heaven) साद्धया देवाs (i.e.) the free Angels exist." "Where do exist the omniscient souls, the first-born and eternal." "The Ever-free Souls see Him always." "All the gods worship वामन who is sitting in their midst." The Ever-free Angels are delineated by these and other such texts. He is their Lord i.e. Master. He is always served by them.

## 71 हिरण्यगर्भः
He who is in a lovely adobe. This name describes भगवान् as being associated with a fitting place. हिरण्य (golden) is the Supreme Abode. The material that goes in the make-up of that place is faultless, eternal and of highly good quality (i.e.Suddha-saththva) and is therefore similar to हिरण्य or gold. Or 'Hitha' and रमणीय', i.e. agreeable and lovely. It is said to be pregnant with Him since He is there always. Thus do some Upanishadic texts describe Him:- "In that supreme and golden (lovely) world Brahman exist which is free from blemish and from parts. It is a sparkling Luminary amongst other luminaries. They alone realize it who meditate upon It. The Sun does not shine there." "अयोध्य is the city of Free souls. There exists in it the gold treasure. The creator entered the golden city which is known as अपराजित (unconquered)".

## 72 भूगर्भस्
He for whom Earth is the object of protection Next the name भुगर्भ denotes that He has भुमी (Earth) as His Consort. Hri, क्षमा and the like are the other names of the Goddess भू or भूमी she is being rejuvenated by Him by constant enjoyment and here in she is like the garbha (womb or child). The वेदाs declare that "Goddess भूमी is the Spouse of विष्णु and ever young." "Thou hast been lifted up from the waters by वराह (भगवान्)" In विष्णु Smruthi it has been dealt within detail.

## 73 माधवः
The consort of मा (i.e. Lakshmi) मायः - of श्री Dhavah - The Husband; i.e. The Consort of Lakshmi. Vide "Lakshmi who is the ruler of this universe and the spouse of विष्णु" "Bhu:mi and Lakshmi are Thy spouses." Even as the essential nature of Lakshmi is described in the शास्त्रा dealing with the Supreme Reality, Her form which is eternal and sportless, Her Supreme rulership which is not restricted by any limiting adjunct. Her universal Motherhood, Her natural association with भगवान् which is eternal and unceasing, are all delineated in great detail in the. In वेदिक Literature श्री सूक्ता, श्रद्धा सूक्त, मेध सूक्त Uththara नारायण, Kaushithaki Brआhmaण and others deal with this subject. In विष्णु पुराण in the episode of the churning of the Milky Ocean the praise of Lakshmi by Indra begins with the following verse and is elaborately described. "This लक्षमी is eternal, the universal Mother and is ever in union with विष्णु . Just as विष्णु pervades all things she also does, O best of Brahmins." Brahma पुराण begins by saying "Her power is invincible and awe-inspiring and she is considered as the power of विष्णु Himself. she is the Supreme Being who lives in the lओtus -like heart of all beings of the universe and she is endowed with diverse forms. Her name is प्राण or life. she is the mother of all मन्त्राs and is the eternal Mother of the Universe." Then it says : "she is the Goddess, dark like broken collyrium, is free from (bad) qualities and is like Ether." "Likewise Lakshmi is His Supreme Power and she is endowed with the quality of Mercy. she is called the Supreme Prakruthi and possesses the six qualities, knowledge and others." Lakshmi is the supreme, unique and eternal Sakthi of भगवान्; she is His second and transforms Herself into diverse forms, high and low. she has innumerable names and is the head of the Sakthi Chakrathe wheel of powers. she stands steady, pervading the entire Universe, moving and non-moving. "she is eternal and inseparably associated with भगवान् वासुदेव, who is the Master of great glory, who is endowed with six qualities, and who is all powerful." she is like the moonlight of the cool - rayed moon; she is one with Him, yet remains distinct. she pervades the Universe and is the very embodiment of all शक्तीs." she is endowed with all glory and qualities, and is eternal. Her dharma is the same as that of भगवान्. she is the life giving Sakthi of all beings on earth. she is the source of all Sakthis and is the sublime element in all." Lakshmi - sahasra speaks of Lakshmi thus; and other texts also must be written. There again it is stated: " All the शक्तीs that have emanated from Lakshmi are always pervading the entire Universe. They remain, under the command of श्री, as the cause. Therefore when Lakshmi, the Mother of the Universe and the beloved consort of भगवान् Achyutha is pleased with some one, these शक्तीs themselves highly pleased, bestow prosperity which he desires." This subject is fully dealt with in वैष्णव Smruthi and other Dharma (शास्त्राs). श्री रामायण describes in full this topic. "The entire-epic poem रामायण is but the glorious story of सीता." "Lord (विष्णु) gets his lordship because of His association with श्रद्धा (i.e. लक्षमी )". This is the secret about the true nature of श्री

## 74 मधुसूदनः
The slayer of Madhu. He is called मधुसूदन because He is the controller of all beings and because he bestows undisputed prosperity by slaying the असुरा-s. The suffix 'Lyu' is added to the root 'सूद' which comes under the group of verbs beginning with 'Nandi' Similarly the names Nanadana (530), Vardhana (262), Madana,संखर्षण (556),जनार्दन (128) are words which have the 'Lyu' suffix in the end. The आर्ष interpretation is as follows: "He is मधुसूदन , because He guides all तत्वा-s and also because He is the slayer of Madhu". Or there is another interpretation:- He who always attracts the sense - organs of Ever-free souls to Himself without any obstacle. "Madhu is the name of the sense-organ. Since He draws them all to Himself He is Madhusudana."

## 75 ईश्वरः
The ruler. He is ईश्वरः because His desire is un - impeded in that boundless world of Supreme Bliss. Vide "His desires are true and His will also is true." "He has self-control and goes wherever He wants."

## 76 विक्रमी
The most powerful. The name Vikrama signifies that His nature is such that it dispels all possibility of anything going against His desire or will. The suffix 'ini' added to the word Vikrama shows that the quality is great, praise - worthy and eternal. vide "He creates and destroys the world by his mere will. When such is His power, should He make any great effort to put down His enemies?" And such other texts also.

## 77 धन्वी
The wielder of the bow He is धन्वी, because He always has the celestial bow, सारन्ग by name, quite suited to His unexcelled valour. Here also the affix 'ini' has been added in the sense of having. धन्वी indicates that He has all the Celestial weapons. "He is the wielder of the bow साrnga. He is हृषीकेश पुरुष and पुरुषोत्त्म. He is invincible and wields the sword. He is विष्णु as well as कृष्ण endowed with great strength." "Arrows of different shapes and a bow of huge size follow Kakuthढtha (i.e. Rँma). All of them have assumed the bodies of human beings." "Therefore, O King! भगावन् नारायण the wielder of the mighty bow is the Creator and Destroyer (of the universe)." 'The two kinds of अहंकार known as the भूतादि and इन्द्रियादि , which stand in the forms of Sankha and सारंग , are held by the Lord."

## 78 मेधावी
The Omniscient. He is endowed with the quality of innate omniscience which is boundless, eternal natural and appropriate to His greatness. The word मेधावी has been formed by the addition of the suffix 'Vini' to मेधा (knowledge) in the sense quoted above by the rule "After a stem ending in 'as', and after the words ' माया', 'मेधा' and 'sraj' comes the affix 'vini' in the sense of possession."

## 79 विक्रमः
He who moves about on the bird Garuda. This name signifies that He goes about here and there as He likes in a playful mood riding on Garuda. Who is the King of birds and the embodiment of three वेदाs. "May we approach and meditate upon Garuda of golden feathers who is the subordinate of the Supreme पुरुष (i.e.भगवान् ). May that Garuda inspire us." The true nature of Garuda may be learnt from the सैपर्ण सुक्ता and other texts. Thasya - of that महापुरुष, पुरुष - शेष i.e. subordinate.

## 80 क्रमः
He who is prosperous. He is highly prosperous by virtue of His being the master of the Eternal and Transcendental Glory. The root 'Krami' is आत्मनेपद and means तायन i.e., prosperity.

## 81 अनुत्तमः
The unsurpassed Vide "There is no one else superior to Him." "Who is there qualified to compete with Him, the Brahman?" "Who can complete with Him?" "There is no one else who is greater than Myself, O Dhananjaya!" "No other being is greater than भगवान् Who exists in all forms (i.e.omnipresent)."

## 82 दुरादर्षः
Who is un assailable. On account of the profundity of His character भगवान् , like the Ocean, cannot be overcome by any one. vide "He is mind-made (i.e. He is realized only by the mind), has प्राण for His body, light for His form; He will the truth, is like the आकाश , is all desires, all sweet odours, all tastes has appropriated all this (set of qualities) and does not speak since there is no one whom He has to respect or please." "He is the Supreme God and is profound by nature." "Like the deep ocean, भगवान् is ever inperturbable." "He resembles the Ocean by virtue of His profound nature," and texts like these. Here are some वेदिक् passages which are relevant to this section. "That is the supreme abode of विष्णु." "In that Parama-आकाश (i.e.) श्री वैकुण्ठ , which is indestructible"; "In the Heaven the मुक्ताs attain (all greatness)." "That resplendent world is mine." "The Celestial place which is undecaying and immeasurable." "Come to that heavenly abode for eternal stay giving up all your worries." "He entered that resplendent world that pertains to विष्णु." "Time with all its divisions of काला, मुहुर्त etc. are never the cause of any mutation of that sublime World of His." "That is the Supreme world of Released Souls." By these texts and those quoted already in the course of the explanation of the several names, it is proclaimed that श्रीमन् नारायण Transcendental World. (i.e. श्री वैकुण्ठ ), like His own essential nature and qualities, is beyond the sway of time, indestructible, devoid of all transmutations; is beyond the range of तमोगुण (i.e. the dark Prakruthi), eternal and a place from which there is no return for those who reach it. "That is only one without a second". "Then there was neither the sentient, nor the non-sentient". By the words 'only one' in the Manthra the doubt may arise if nothing else exists except भगवान् . But the supreme Transcendental world श्री वैकुण्ठ is not nullified by this since that world also is eternal and unique. In that श्री वैकुण्ठ , भगवान् नारायण is with His Celestial Consorts, Sri and Bhu:mi. He is on a Celestial Couch which is in a Celestial Hall about which we learn from the Paryanka Vidya in the कौषीतकि उपनिषद् and others; Service to भगवान् is being done by the Eternally free Angels like Anantha, वैनातेय (i.e.Garuda) and विष्वक्सेन about whom mention has been already made. Thus the supreme sovereignty and the universal rulership which is for the benefit of the world and which is for the benefit of the world and which is the great secret of the वेदाs, has been delineated. This is clearly stated in the Saiva पुरुष narrated by वायु "The Lord of the Universe dwells in the Supreme Region of वौकुण्ठ along with Lakhsmi. The incomprehensible परमात्म is there with His devotees as well as the devotees of those devotees." The विष्णु Thaththva says "The Lord whose body is composed of the five शक्तीs ( Celestial Powers) and who is the ruler of the rulers of the outside world" dwells in the Supreme Region ( वौकुण्ठ) replete with Bless in the enjoyment of self." (The five शक्तीs (or powers) are Time, knowledge, action, desire and life.)

## 83 कृतज्ञः
He who is greatful. This name signifies that the Lord remembers the little good will shown to Him by the human beings in the world. Despite the fact that they have forgotten the natural relationship between them (viz, that He is their Master and they are His servants); and they think, that all things belong to them and are acting as though they are independent due to their ignorance from beginningless time. "The affix 'ka' comes after a verbal root that ends in 'आ' when three is no upasarga (preposition) preceding it (and when the object is in composition with it." The names 'Brahmagjna' (674), 'प्राणद' (66,323,409,956) and others come under this rule. The declaration (of श्री कृष्ण in गीता ) is as follows: "If a man, even of exceedingly wicked conduct, (worships me without resorting to anyone else,) he must be esteemed (and honoured) as being indeed righteous. For he is rightly resolved." In the case of such a devotee Lord does not see anything that He can do by way of return for his good act. "That cry for help uttered aloud by Draupadi even from a distance calling me 'गोविन्द' that cry is never away from my mind like a debt that has increased with the interest accumulated on it."

## 84 कृतिः
He is Himself that act. That virtuous act of the जीवा-s owes its origin to the Lord who is pleased. vide "He makes that person do virtuous acts whom He wants to lift up from worlds of material existence." "And the affix 'Kthin' comes after a root when the sense is that of an appellative, the word being related to the verb from which its name is deduced as a कारक, but not as an agent कारक. Here it is with reference to a word in the feminine gender. 'भूति' (636) 'सिद्धि' (99) and others also come under this group.

## 85 आत्मवान्
The possessor of the souls. The souls, who are the doers of such (virtuous) acts are His own property since their essential nature and actions are dependent on Him.

## 86 सुरेशः
The lord of gods. He is सुरेश, because it is He who confers even on Brahma and others the small posts desired by them. So does Brahma say "By the Grace of भगवान् Achyutha, I have become the creator of the beings; and by His wrath, rudra became the destroyer of the beings. That Achyutha is the cause of the substenance (of this universe)."

## 87 शरणं
The refuge. He is the Refuge for all without a difference. The word 'शरणं' is derived from the root 'sr' which signifies protection with the addition of the suffix 'Lyuth' करणं (380) ,कारणं (381), प्रमाण (430,959) and other names also have been similarity formed. He is the means not conditioned by any limiting adjuncts. "Being desirous of Release I seek refuge in that Deity who reveals knowledge about Himself." "नारायण is the abode, the refuge, friend and the goal of attainment." "The divine sages refer to Thee as the Protector and the Refuge".

## 88 शर्म
Bliss . Sarma is His name. He is Sarma i.e. Bliss which is the highest goal to be attained. The suffix 'माणिन् ' has been added to denote the sense of happiness. Vide "He is all smell and all taste" "Brahman is (Supreme) happiness Brahman is the either." (i.e.) the nature of Brahman as bliss is in itself infinite and indescribable. "Brahman is Bliss."

## 89 विश्वरेताः
He whose creation the universe is. He creates all the organs of action for the sole purpose of investing the beings with knowledge, place and residence and service to him. This name explains how He is the Refuge and also the source of Bliss. The Universe is His creation; He permeates all the organs of action for the sole purpose of investing the beings with knowledge, place and residence and service to Him. Vide "From this (Supreme being) do emerge life, mind and all the sense -organs as well as ether, air, water and earth which supports all in the Universe." (The two eyes, the two ears, the two nostrils and mouth) These seven sense organs emanate from Him." "The various mental states of beings arise from Me alone." श्री विष्णु Thaththva says "Brahman! This wonderful wealth, namely body, associated with hands, legs etc., has already been created by me with a view to enable the beings to use them in the service of the Supreme."

## 90 प्रजाभवः
The adobe of the Prajas i.e., living beings. Along with the limbs etc. granted by भगवान् all beings rest in Him; in other words they become fit for being drawn towards Him. The affix 'Gha' generally comes in the sense of an instrument or location, after a root, when the word to be formed is a name and is in the masculine gender." आsramah (856), Niyamah (163,869) Yamah ( 164,870) and others also are governed by this rule.

## 91 अहः
He who never forsakes any one This name signifies there is no one who is abandoned by Him. The ancient etymological work says; "He is Ahah since He does not forsake anyone." गीता also declares "No one who does what is good, dear friend, ever meets with a sad fate." Or भगवान् is Ahah (day) because like the day He brings about the waking of the beings who have been in the deep sleep of beginningless Avidya or Nescience.

## 92 संवत्सरः
He who lives When the beings are awake like this, He lives for their uplift. Therefore He is Samvathsarah. The suffix 'शरण' is added to the root 'vas' (to dwell) when it is proceded by the preposition 'sam' and the affix is treated as 'chith', which places the accent on the last syllable. By another rule, 'tha' is substituted for the final 'sa' of a root before an अर्धधातुक affix beginning with 's'. (Vas+sara =वत्सर) "I give with love that particular mental condition (of Bhakthi) by which they attain me." "I redeem them from the world."

## 93 व्यालः
He who accepts the devotees. "O the king of monkeys! ( सुग्रीव ) I Bring him (विभीषण), for I have offered him protection." On this principle भगवान् makes them His own. So He is व्याल. The word is derived from the root 'ला' (to take or accept). The suffix 'ka' is placed after a root, the final letter of which is 'आ' when it is preceded by a preposition (Vi+आ + ला +k = व्यालः)

## 94 प्रत्ययः
One who can be relied upon. He is Prathyayah since one places confidence in Him. For He makes all have confidence in Him. Vide- "That Deity who reveals knowledge about Himself" In विष्णु तत्वा- "O Brahmin That Supreme Person (परुषोत्तम) should be relied upon more and more." श्री कृष्ण Himself says in सभा पर्व (महाभारत) "If Your heart understands me, and if you have faith in me, place भीम and Arjuna immediately at my disposal.

## 95 सर्वदर्शनः
He who displays all his glory. भगवान् shows all His greatness to them (who have faith in Him shows all His greatness to them (who have faith in Him). Vide "When a person realises the greatness of the Supreme ruler that He is not tainted by the touch of Karma, then by His Grace he becomes free from all grief." "To Him this Self (i.e.भगवान्) reveals His own form."

## 96 अजः
Rmover of all obstacles. He Himself removes all obstacles which prevent the जीवा-s from attaining Him. The root 'Aj' signifies movement or throwing away and the affix 'Ach' is added to form the word ' अजः'. "Out of mercy to those very persons. I, who am in their mental structure (as the object of thought), dispel the darkness of ignorance by means of the luminous lamp of knowledge." "I will se thee free from all sins." And so on.

## 97 सर्वेश्वरः
He who reaches all. He is called सर्वेश्वरः because He quickly reaches all those who have taken refuge in Him, whether they are qualified or not in order to avoid delay in dispelling their uneasiness, The affix 'varath' comes after the root 'vas' (to pervade) when the word formed from it refers to having the power of granting success soon, and the penultimate letter 'a' of 'as' is replaced by 'ई' and thus (ई+s+vara) the word 'ईश्वर' is formed. "He (राम immediately obtained the company of विभीषण."

## 98 सिद्धः
He who is ever-existing With reference to the devotees, He is in their hands. Pratthithah (321), Hitha (8) and other names come under the same rule of derivation. They are past participle forms. He is not something that has to be prepared by some means or other. "Wise men say that Brahman itself is न्यास" (Surrender). (That is Brahman is the means and the goal).

## 99 सिद्धिः
Goal. He is Siddhi, because He is the goal to be reached by adopting the means vide "Desirous of attaining Him, they practise celibacy". "My salutations to Him who is the very embodiment of Dharma, towards whom some adopt a unique Dharma, from whom some desire diverse fruits of Dharma, and whom some worship by different धर्माs."

## 100 सर्वादिः
The source of all. भगवान् is the cause or source of all the goals. High or low, of His devotees. Vide "Those devotees who steadily worship Thee, Supreme Purusha, the Deity, the ancient and the immutable, attain always their desires both in this world and in the other." "By the mere utterance of the name of श्री कृष्ण, they realize all their great desires in the three worlds of this Universe."

## 101 अच्युतः
He who never seperated. He is never away from those who have sought refuge in Him. "I have never abandoned (my भक्ताs). Because of this act of mine I am known as Achyutha." "I do not disappear from him." "Never will I abandon him."

## 102 वृषाकपिः
Varaha, the Dharma Incarnate It is being declared that Achyutha is no other than the Dharma-वराह. Such is the etymology given by the ancient seers:- "Kapi is the sublime वराह and वृष is Dharma. Therefore I am वृषाकपि . काश्यप, the प्रजापति (the secondary creator) declared about me thus."

## 103 अमेयात्मा
He who is of an incomprehensible nature. Thus भगवान् the spring from which flow the blessings to His devotees. About Him, the शास्त्राs say:-- "Therefore the पुरुष is greater, superior." As revealed by these texts He is अमेयात्मा i.e., His essential nature cannot be comprehended by any one that, it is this much.

## 104 सर्वयोग
विनिस्सृतः He who can be attained by all means To the question, "How is He great?" the answer is सर्वयोग विनिस्सृतः. Through the practice of all the योगा-s (i.e.means) laid down in the शास्त्रा-s as well as those determined by one's own intelligence, which are very much like the great secrets propounded by the वेदाs, it is possible to attain Him. Or it may be said He is easily attainable. Vide "परमात्मा, the Lord of the Universe, is ever with that person who realises Him by means of comprehension through his mind alone, becoming pleased with the enjoyment of His (परमात्म) glory." In पौष्कर (Samhitha) it is stated. "The Lord of the Manthras becomes pleased before long with those who seek refuge in Him provided they have pure devotion and have meditated upon Him, though not in the prescribed manner. When such is the case, it goes without saying that He becomes pleased with those who are fully equipped with virtuous acts and knowledge, who are endowed with faith and devotion, and who have been instructed by the आचार्याs, O पौष्कर!" In विष्णु Thaththva! "If भगवान् माधव accepts a person who is devoted to Him, though only by mind, is it possible to determine that only this amount of his misery has been wiped out and not more than that?"

## 105 वसुः
He who dwells . भगवान् is called वसु since He is pleased with even this small amount of devotion and lives in them. The roots 'वसि' (to dwell), श्री etc. take, the affix 'u'.

## 106 वसुमनाः
He who has a heart while thinks of His devotees as a treasure. Vasu - treasure; He is called ' वसुमनः', since, His mind thinks of them as treasure. "That high-souled man is very hard to find."

## 107 सत्यः
He who is well disposed. भगवान् is called 'Sathyah' since He is well-disposed towards pious souls. "The affix 'yath' comes after a word in the locative case in the sense of excellent thereto."

## 108 समात्मा
He whose mind is uniformly disposed. His mind is equally disposed towards all even though they may be high or low by virtue of their qualities and it does not proceed to think of their merits or demerits. Vide "I am the same in relation to all beings."

## 109 सम्मितः
He who has been rightly understood. The short 'इ' is substituted for the final of the roots 'do' 'so' 'मा' and 'स्था' ('मा' + इ = mitha). It has been well appraised (by His devotees) that He is in their hands, (as said by Dasarattha, वासुदेव and others):- "My राम, the lotus-eyed, is less than sixteen years old." "He (श्री कृष्ण) is my own son."

## 110 समः
He who is of a uniform disposition. भगवान्s attitude is the same towards all His devotees. He does not bestow any thought on the fact whether the person is known to Him or not known to Him and whether his devotion is intense, or mild. The letter 'a' of औनादि has been added to the root 'Sam' (not to be confused).

## 111 अमोघः
He who is never futile. The true contact of the devotees with भगवान् is never fruitless, vide "Oh राम! A sight of Thee is never futile. The Praise also of Thee is never futile. Those men who are endowed with devotion to Thee will always be successful (in their life)."

## 112 पुण्डरीकाक्षः
The eye of Pundarika, i.e the Transcedental world. "पुण्डरीक is the Transcendental world which is eternal, indestructible and immutable. Thou art like the eye to that world and so Thou art known as पुण्डरीकाक्ष ," That is to say, that He is like the eye to the residents of the eternal वैकुण्ठ. Vide "Thou art like the broad eye in the Heavens."

## 113 वृषकर्मा
He of righteous actions. Even though He is far above us, He always brings welfare on people like us in the manner mentioned earlier. Therefore all His acts are वृषा (Dharma i.e. Virtuous.) So He is known as वृषृ कर्म .

## 114 वृषाकृतिः
He of Dharmic form. He is वृषाकृतिi, since, His form also is of the nature of वृषा (i.e.Dharma). Or He is वृषकर्म and वृषाकृति because, He possesses a beautiful form and also does acts which are cool and refreshing like the shower of Nectar which puts out the threefold heat (i.e. sufferings of the world) The root 'वृषु' signifies sprinkling. Vide सात्वत (Samhitha) with reference to the meditation on the Supreme (Godhead). "The Supreme refreshes the universe with his lustre which is like that of ten thousand full moons." In श्री पैष्कर "With His form which is beautiful, lustrous and unchanging, He always emits the light of knowledge out of his body. To bring about the cessation of the suffering of those who meditate on him and who are burnt by the fire of the करमाs of previous births, He sheds heaps of rays from His moon - like face and delights them." In राज धर्म "Then he saw श्री कृष्ण who was seated on a great throne made of gold and adorned with gems, and who was like a blue cloud resting on Mount मेरु."

## 115 रुद्रः
He who makes devotees shed tears of joy. He is called rudra because He makes His devotees shed tears of joy with their hearts moved by His fascinating form and diverse virtuous acts. The word rudra means 'one who makes others cry'. The root 'रोद' (to shed tears) takes the affix 'Rak' and there is the elision of the causative sign 'ni'. Vide श्री विष्णु तत्वा "That devout person whose eyes are brimming with the cool tears of joy. Whose body is covered with hairs on their ends (due to joy) and whose heart is ever filled with thoughts about the qualities of the Supreme Being, he must be seen by all embodied souls."

## 116 बहुशिरा
Multi headed. (As Anantha) He has many heads and more than a thousand hoods.

## 117 बभ्रुः
The supporter. In the form as Ananata he bears the world. In this form (as Anantha) He bears (the worlds). After the root 'Bhrun' (to support) comes the augment 'ku' and the letter 'Bha' is reduplicated." "He (as Anantha) bears the series of worlds and the entire Universe is rendered red by the rays of the gem (on his hoods) that pertain to Him" "Anantha bears the world which has a secure place on His head."

## 118 विश्वयोनिः
He who associates Himself with all. "He has dedicated His form as Anantha for embracing His devotees which is common to all and relished by them. He makes all those who desire to attain Him, join Him." The word 'योनि' is derived from the root 'yu' (to join or unite), The affix 'nith' comes after the roots 'vah', 'Srं', 'Sru' 'yu' 'dru' 'glai' 'हा' and 'thvar'.

## 119 शुचिश्रवाः
He who listens to the pure words. He is शुचिश्रवाः, since, He surely listens to the words of His devotees. "O Dhananjaya! (Arjuna) I listen here to all that is pure and agreeable to hear. I do not heed to what is sinful. Therefore I am known as 'शुचिश्रवाः' That alone is pure which is offered with devotion. Vide "I ate the good and pure food offered with devotion by Vidura." "The night passed away for कृष्णा unnoticed as He listened to the varied worlds of the high-souled Vidura-words which were full of dharma, fascinating, significant, and which contained good imports and sweet sounds and letters."

## 120 अमृतः
The ambrosia He is known as Amrutha, because He is sweet to the devotees to an unlimited extent, or because He wards off old age and death to them, or because they never get satisfied inspite of their constantly doing service to them. "When the sages saw जनार्दन, they never got satiated as with nectar."

## 121 शाश्वतः
स्थाणुः He who is eternal and steady. By Himself He is eternal and cannot be taken away from those who are enjoying Him. The nectar, which is the essence of the Ocean, is known as such because of its having just a little of the above-mentioned power. But, भगवान् is different from it, because He is शाश्वत and स्थाणु (Eternal and steady). By Himself He is eternal and cannot be taken away from those who are enjoying Him. He is the object of enjoyment to those who never think of returning to the world of mortals for rebirth. That other nectar (obtained from the ocean) is not only transitory, but can be taken in only once.

## 122 वरारोहः
He who is the Supreme object of attainment.For this reason varam- Supreme, aarohanam - is the attainment of Bhagavan. For this reason, varam Supreme, आरोहणम् is the attainment of भगवान्. That of all else is inferior. Vide "Compared with that world of the Supreme Being, these lower worlds (of Brahma and Indra) are like hell." The doctrine of the भागवताs holds that the Supreme Brahman has three aspects, Para, व्यूह and वैभव. Amongst them, the Para is that form which is not conditioned by any limiting adjuncts and which is not the effect of another object. It is endowed with the six qualities (knowledge, strength etc.) It is like a great ocean with surging waves. It has a world of enjoyment which is boundless and eternal, and in which it exercises undisputed sovereignty. That again is the object of attainment for the released souls.The व्यूह (or Emanation) is in four forms (वासुदेव, समाकर्षण Pradyumna and Aniruddha) assumed by भगवान् with a desire for the creation of persons who have a longing for release. They are incharge of the work of creation, sustenance and destruction; they propound the भगवान्s, explain their significance and give the fruits in accordance with the rules laid down therein; they also teach the method of meditation and worship of भगवान्, and other things which pertain to the लीला or sport of भगवान्. The six qualities of the Para रूप are allocated amongst the four व्यूहा and each has its own form and duties. They are the means for the attainment of salvation. The Vibhava is that group of manifestations of the Lord which are taken by His own will, which are like the व्यूहा-s, which are of the same species as god man, animal and so on, and which belong to the same class as His own glory. Vide the सात्वता (Samhitha) which begins thus (with the delineation of the Para or the Transcendental form). "The Lord has a body endowed with all the six qualities. He ढines with intense brilliance and luminosity, and has hands and feet all around. This is called Para-ru:pa which is unique, which is the support of all and which is all-pervasive. From this emerge three other forms संकर्षण, Pradyumna and Aniruddha) which are distinguiढed by the possession of knowledge and other qualities alloted to each one of them and which bestow the fruit, namely Beatitude. These are known as व्यूह-s or Emanations. The Vibhava is of two kinds Mukthya and Anuvruththi (i.e. Vibhava and Vibhavanthara). They are also endowed with knowledge and other qualities. There are diverse forms of this Vibhava and their worship confers the fruits, viz. joy here and bliss in the other world. In them, (1) some like Mathsya and कूर्म are direct manifestations; (2) in some incarnations, the Lord enters into the bodies of distinguished sages like भार्गव राम (परशुराम), कृष्ण-द्वैपायन (व्यास) etc. In other वैभवाs He invests His Sakthi for some period in some persons as in the case of Puranjaya and others. Three are yet others in which He manifests Himself, in idols, as for instance in the अर्चावतार (or the incarnation in Icons). Thus there are four aspects (beside the पर-रूप ). Here an objection is raised by some Brahma and others also may be conceived to be the Incarnations of भगवान्. Since it is taught in some places that there is no difference between them and the परमात्म. This should be treated, as the prattling of a dunce. If that view is accepted, people like us and grass and other things also will have to be taken as Incarnations. For in regard to all these things also, it is stated that there is no difference between them and Brahman, Vide"All this is indeed Brahman". Moreover Brahma and others are not as a rule included in the class of the incarnations of भगवान्; but they are classified along with gods, human beings and others as created beings in scriptures where creation is referred to. On the contrary there are several statements in the Bhagavath-शास्त्राs (i.e. पञ्चरत्र-literature) to the effect that Brahma, rudra, and Indra are different from the प्रादुर्भावाs or Incarnations of परमात्म; that they are mentioned as प्रादुर्भावा of भगवान्; that they are created by a fraction of the great glory of भगवान्; that they are created by a fraction of the great glory of भगवान्, and that their very existence and activities are dependent on the Incarnations of भगवान्. (It is therefore established in the शास्त्राs that they are distinct from the प्रादुर्भाव (or अवतार) of भगवान् and that they are His Possessions). In पौष्कर Samhitha (it is stated) "The red-eyed भगवान्, अधोक्षज, is the teacher of all knowledge. The four faced Brahma who is the embodiment of learning and who is worshipped by all the worlds, is only a tiny Amsa (part) of भगवान् and he is the subordinate of भगवान्, since he propounds the knowledge he got from भगवान् to all in the world". The word 'yasya' (whose) indicates that Brahma is only a part of विष्णु in His incarnation as kapila and the word 'Visvavyanjana लक्षण' indicates, He is the subordinate of विष्णु. That the Amsa signifies the foremost part is stated by the Brahma सुत्र"It (the individual soul) is a part of Para Brahman), because its distinction from Para Brahman is taught (by the शास्त्राs)." Similarly the emanation of the other god (i.e. rudra) from Anala-साई (i.e. भगवान् who lies on fire) is described as follows. "महारुद्र, who is also known as Sankara, brings about the destruction of the universe always at the end of the युगाs. He too is a distinct emanation (प्रादुर्भाव-अन्तर) of the Lord who is अनलसायि and who is also at the base of all things supporting them." The word 'Anthara' in 'प्रादुर्भाव-अन्त' signifies भेद or difference as in the case of the word 'anthara' in the following verse "इक्षुक्षीर गुडादीनां माधुर्यस्य अन्तरं महत्" (i.e. "There is a vast differnce in the sweetness) of sugarcane, milk and jaggery." प्रादुर्भाव (emanation) and प्रादुर्भाव अन्तर (other emanation) have been defined as being clearly different from each other. "Those which are produced purely by the act of भगवान् known as प्रादुरभावाs. But प्रादुर्भाव अन्तर (other incarnations) are brought about by 'amsa' (a small part) of भगवान् In this श्लोक the phrase 'Purely by the act of भगवान् Himself" (स्वव्यापारवशत्) signifies that it is the act of the unique Self (भगवान् ). The use of the words 'Bhuth' (thu) and 'amsa-vasa) shows that there is distinction between प्रादुर्भाव and प्रादुर्भाव अन्तर and that the latter is subordinate to the former. Again they are defined similarly elsewhere. " प्रादुर्भाव (incarnation) is the change of the body of भगवान् without giving up His own nature. But that Reality which emanates from an amsa (or a part) of भगवान् is known as प्रादुर्भाव अन्तर (other Incarnation)." Similarly there is the subdivision of Mukhya and औपचारिक (Principal and Secondary) in these. Vide "O Brahman! All these प्रादुर्भावs and प्रादुर्भाव अन्तरs as well as the creation and Dissolution, Gods etc. are of two kinds, Principle and secondary." Likewise with reference to those desirous of Release it has been laid down that they should worship the प्रादुर्भाव (Incarnation of भगवान्) and they should not worship the प्रादुर्भाव अन्तरs (other Incarnations). "When persons are initiated into the मन्त्रs and are invested with the qualification for the worship of Achyutha for the attainment of the state of Salvation, the worship of gods other than Achyutha is prohibited for them. भगवान् Achyutha in His forms named व्युह (Emanations) or वैभवs (incarnations) alone already mentioned, should be worshipped." The worship of Skanda, rudra, महेन्द्र and the like is prohibited in regard to them. Knowing this, a person should not engage himself in the worढip of all and Sunday. "(and should not bring about confusion in devotion)." In श्रीसात्वतसंहित it has been clearly declared that the Consorts (श्री भूमी and नीला) Ornaments (Crown, श्रीवत्स, Sankha and Chakra), and attendants (Garuda , Anantha and विश्वक्सेन) are all instruments for the enjoyment of the Bliss of भगवान् and therefore form part of His body. Time, Brahma, Siva and others are instruments for the creation of the material world which are conducive to the joy of the लीला (or sport).Vide "In this way the hosts of gods alone with the numerous मन्त्रs and their accessories, stand clinging themselves to the body of भगवान् . I sall now state the foremost group of group who are the instruments in the creation of the words, who are endowed with magnificent bodies and who carry out the commands of भगवान्. Time is under His control. So are the शास्त्राs with their accessories, gods that preside over knowledge, the ocean, Siva with his hosts, the group of प्रजापतिs, Indra with his followers, the seven ancient Sages and other seers, the planets along with the clusters of stars, the clouds, all the serpents, the lovely bevy of the Apsarasँs (divine damsels), medical herbs, animals, all the sacrifices along with their accessories, the विद्याs, higher and lower, Fire and Air, the Sun and the Moon, Water and Earth. The तत्वs, twenty four in number, are the chief components in the composition of the material world. This world is प्रधान which is all-pervasive and non-sentient by nature. With the recitation of the मन्त्रs and the meditation on the Lord of the मन्त्र this also becomes an object of worship." Therefore the reference to the four-faced (Brahma) and others in the जन्म-रहस्य in श्री पौष्कर must be understood due to their being included amongst the posessions of प्रादुर्भाव (i.e. Incarnations of भगवान्). Consequently the theory propounded by the wiseacres that the त्रिमूर्तीs (ब्रह्म, विष्णु and शिव) are of equal status is only to their ignorance. All this will be established with arguments in the proper places as occasion arises. The transcendental nature (Parathva) of परमार्थ has been spoken of mostly by the names ending with 'वरारोह' (122). Generally speaking here ends the portion comprising the two question and replies regarding the goal of attainment and their reply. The questions put were "(1) किं एकं दैवतं लोके? (2)किं वाऽप्येकं परायणम् ?" which is the supreme deity and which is the supreme goal of attainment? Hereafer with the question "Sthuvanthah Kam?" (Eulogisin whom)? Etc. which refers to the means of attainment and the answers there to begin the 'व्युह' (Emanations of the Lord) Amongst them (which are four in number -वासुदेव, संकर्षण, प्रद्युम्न and अनिरुद्ध), वासुदेवa may be taken to have been dealt with when the Para aspect was spoken of. With the names beginning with महातपः 'संकर्षण' (the second in the व्यूहs) is going to be dealt with. संकर्षण, प्रद्युम्न and अनिरुद्ध

## 123 महातपाः
He who is endowed with great knowledge. He has knowledge which is to be highly revered. Vide "of Him who is possessed of 'तपस्' 'तपस्' signifies great knowledge. All the six qualities are going to be delineated. Our of them two qualities knowledge and strength are associated with संकर्षण. Here knowledge is interpreted as the desire for taking in people so that there may be the cessation of the miseries of the world which they have been having from time immemorial.

## 124 सर्वगः
He who reaches all. By His strength which displays His capacity to support. भगवान् supports, like the आत्मन् all these whom He has taken in and thus He reaches all. So He is called Sarvagah. "The 'Da' affix comes after the verb 'gam' (to go) when in composition with the following words as its objects antha, athyantha, adhva, du:ra, para, sarva, and anantha. His name 'संकर्षण' (556) signifies that He draws all to Himself and so has it been etymologically derived.

## 125 सर्ववित्
He who obtains all. Then with a desire to create all that had been drawn to Him, (भगवान् as) Pradyumna obtains all through creation. Herein lies His greatness in the delightful display of His power to create the Universe.

## 126 भानुः
He who shines Though भगवान् creates all things, He remains unchanged and shines. The affix 'नु' is added to the roots 'भा' (to shine) and 'दा' (to give)" (भा + नु = भानु ). "He shone by Himself" is the relevant text. It is His virility which keeps Him unchanged (when He changes all).

## 127 विष्वक्सेनः
He who is equipped with an army in all directions for the protection of all Next the Protector Aniruddha is refered to by the name विष्वक्सेन. Yaska derives the name as follows: "इनेन सह वर्तते इति सेन". He is सेनः (सेश्वरः) because He remains with 'ina' (the master). All beings in all the Worlds have a protector in Him for them. Here His Sakthi (Splendour) which shows His capacity is indicated.

## 128 जनार्दनः
The destroyer of the persons who are antagonistic. The destroyer of persons ( who are antagonistic). He is known as जनार्दन since He destroys without expecting any outside help those persons who are antagonistic to the protection of people. Vide "He is जनार्दन because He protects the people from Dasyus (demons). This is तेजस् or power to overcome enemies without standing in need of external help. The restricted number of qualities in the forms (संकर्षण, प्रद्युम्न and अनिरुद्ध्) signifies that only those qualities are manifested, in action (while all others are latent). But the qualities of भगवान् are never concealed. Vide- it is stated in Mura Samhitha. "Knowledge, lordship, splendour all these qualities of भगवान् are not in a less measure, but are in full. The supreme Soul has four forms ( वासुदेव,संकर्षण, प्रद्युम्न, and अनिरुद्ध ). He knows all and sees all. He is the Lord of all and is omnipotent. He is possessed of immense riches. He is free from the knots of Karma and is not wanting in anything. He is a trusted friend of all. He has all under His control, but He is not under the control of any one. He is beginningless and also endless. He is devoid of slumber and fear, wrath and lethargy. He is bereft of desires and ignorance, fatigue and disease. He is free from foibles and unwelcome things and He is spotless. Those who have realized that भगवान् is possessed of these qualities, have understood Him correctly; and those who have not realized in this way, have not understood Him. Therefore भगवान् वासुदेव is both endless and boundless. Thus He stands supreme by virtue of the qualities of endlessness and boundlessness. Such is the text in every Section."

## 129 वेदः
The propounder of the Vedas. Again by the name 'वेद' it is stated that संकर्षण is the propounder of the शास्राs. "And after a verb ending in a consonant comes the affix 'घञ्' (When the word to be formed is masculine and related to the verb as an instrument)." (Vid+a+h (वेदः ) (By which all known). The Sruthi declares "He who taught the वेदा-s to Him (i.e. Brahma)." The Means (for salvation,आगमा-s (or scriptures), path, Leader, ब्राह्मणा and आचार्य (or Teacher) are the various names by which संकर्षण is known.

## 130 वेदवित्
The knower of the Vedas. He is 'वेदवित्' since He knows the meaning of the वेदा-s without doubt or mistake. भगवान् Himself said (in the गीता) "I am indeed the knower of the वेदा-s."

## 131 अव्यङ्गः
He who is not bereft of the limbs (of the vedas). भगवान् is know as 'अव्यङ्गः' since He is not bereft ( of the knowledge) of the Chhandas, Kalpa and other accessories of the वेदा-s which He Himself has created.

## 132 वेदाङ्गः
He who has the vedas as His Body. The वेदा-s with their innumerable branches are said to be His body since they reveal the inner-most secrets of भगवान् . Vide "He, who does not know the वेद , does not know that infinite Brahman." "He shakes His body composed of the वेदा-s" Or the name वेदाङ्गः can be taken to signify that the श्रुती-s and स्मृती-s are His body since they are His commands. Vide "श्रुती-s and स्मृती-s are my ordinances." "That which is due to the Gods and the Pithrs must be carried out." "This is His command."

## 133 वेदवित्
He who makes people practise what is laid down in the वेदा-s What is known by the वेदा-s is here said to be वेदा-s (i.e. ) its meaning, dharma. He has a knowledge of the Dharma which He makes others pracise and He does it as Pradyumna who is called वेदवित् here. Hence, His appellations are Dharma, the illuminator, and the Instigator.

## 134 कविः
He who sees beyond. He is ' कविः' since He cognises all that is beyond ordinary perception. The affix 'in' has been added to the root 'ku' which signifies the act of seeing.

## 135 लोकाध्यक्षः
He who controls the world

## 136 सुराध्यक्षः
He who controls the gods

## 137 धर्माध्यक्षः
He who controls Dharma The word ' लोका' signifies those who are eligible for the practice of dharma. 'Sura' signifies the gods who are worshipped with the Dharma. 'Dharma' signifies the means of worship prescribed (by the शास्त्रा-s). The अध्यक्ष or the presiding Deity over all these isभगवान् as अनिरुध्ध who closely observes so that He can grant the fruits of the Dharmic acts. He also sees that fruits are not obtained by those who do not practise the Dharma and that those who practise it do not go without the fruit. Hence He is known by the names of धर्मज्ञ (the knower of Dharma), उपायज्ञः ( He who knows the means), अध्यक्ष (the presiding Deity), Sathya-Sandhah (Highly Truthful); He alone bestows the knowledge of all this.

## 138 कृताकृतः
The grantor of the fruits in this world and in the other The grantor of the fruits in this world and in the other. Dharma is of two kinds: (1) प्रवर्तक धर्म (which prolongs the संसार ) and (2) निवर्तक dharma (which puts since He grants transitory fruits to the Pravarthaka dharma (which is this-worldly); and He is called Akrutha since He confers eternal fruit on those who practise Nivarthaka-dharma. Therefore भगवान् is called ' कृताकृतः."

## 139 चतुरात्मा
He of four forms. Since भगवान् is in four forms ( वासुदेव, संकर्षण, Pradyumna and Aniruddha) He is known as चतुरात्मा .

## 140 चतुर्व्यूहः
He who is with four forms. How can one have four forms? The answer is 'चतुर्व्यूहः'. For the purposes mentioned above and for showing the forms that have to be meditated upon and worshipped. भगवान् manifests Himself in four forms one of which is endowed with all the six qualities and the other three with two weapons, vehicles, banners, etc., and which are also in the fourfold divine states of जागरत् etc. Note The four fold states are जागरत् -Wakeful State, Svapna-State of dreams; सुषुप्ती -Dreamless deep sleep; and तुरीय - the fourth and final State. Each of this states is in groups of four. In the first group up external senses function; in the second group they do not function, only the mind is active; in the group third group even the mind does not function, there is only breathing; in the fourth group even the breath is suspended. In the Paramapada there is a column (pillar) composed of Suddha-saththva material which is known by the name of विशाख-स्तंभ. There are four parts in the pillar from the base upwards and on the four sides of each part are the four व्यूह -forms- वासुदेव, संकर्षण, प्रद्युम्न and अनिरुद्ध . The four parts with four व्यूह in each correspond to the four stages of development that may be found in the worshipper who meditates on them.)

## 141 चतुर्दंष्ट्रः
He of four teeth. He is possessed of four teeth in His transcendental form which is the source from which all the four व्यूह-s or Emanations emerge. Hence भगवान् is known as चतुर्दंष्ट्रः. The possession of four large teeth is considered to be the special mark of a great person. Vide "Chathur-dasa-sama - dvandvah चतुर्दंष्ट्रः चतुर्गतीः ." (The eyelashes, nostrils, eyes ears, lips, chest, eyebrows, wrist, knees, testicles, hips, hands legs and heels) these fourteen, parts which are in pairs are mutually alike; रामा has four broad teeth. His gait is of four kinds like those of the lion, tiger, elephant and bull).

## 142 चतुर्भुजः
He of four arms. He is four armed. They say that such is the परारूप or the Trancendental form. "He is possessed of four arms, is of a highly generous nature and has discus and other weapons and ornaments." "He who is in a place beyond darkness (the material world) and who wields the conch, discus and mace." "He who is endowed with four arms." And so on.

## 143 भ्राजिष्णुः
The effulgent This Transcendental form is manifested as Emanations ( व्युहा-s) described above which are effulgent. The affix 'Ishnuch" in the sense of agent having such a habit etc. comes after the root 'भू:' (to be)". It is the nature of भगवान् to show Himself to the worshippers.

## 144 भोजनं
Food i.e the object of enjoyment. भगवान् is Bhओjanam since, He is enjoyed (भुज्यते) with pleasure by His worshippers.

## 145 भोक्ता

## 146 सहिष्णुः
The forgiver. He is called 'सहिष्णुः' since, it is His nature to forgive the innumerable sins of people when they become well-disposed towards Him accumulated sins which have been committed before or are about to be committee later, since committed consciously or unconsciously by all the organs of sense at all times and in all ways, sins committed by not observing the injunctions or by doing acts forbidden by the शास्त्रा-s, sins that are common and uncommon, sins committed by insulting Him and abusing Him, as well as the sins towards His own devotees which He who puts up with everything, can never endure. All these He forgives. The suffix 'Ishnuch' comes after 'Alamkr', 'Sah' and other verbs in the sense of the agent having such a habit etc." If it is asked how His patience is this much and so great, the answer is given by the use of the 'Ishnuch' suffix which signifies a quality which is natural to Him even like the coolness that is natural to the moon, water and others. The व्यूह or Emanations have been dealt with thus.

## 147 जगदादिजः
He who was born at the beginning of the universe. Next the वैभवा-s are being dealt with. वैभवा-s, the Incarnation as (विष्णु) the second of the Trinity is signified by the name जगदादिजः. He is born as one of the Trinitythe three deities that are at the beginning of the world. The affix 'da' come after the verb 'Jan' (to be produced) with a past signification when the world in composition with it is in the Locative case.आदिजातः = आदिजः . The names मेधजः (759) and गदाग्रजः (770) and others also are governed by this grammatical rule. VideThe words of Brahma. "By the grace of Achyutha I am the creator of the beings of the world; by His wrath rudra is the destroyer; born of the Supreme Being between the two (myself and rudra) Parama पुरुष is the sustainer of the Universe." The gods say in the Udyओga Parva (of महाभारता ) the same thing: "Thou art our refuge; Thou art the first-born amongst the gods. Thou art the Lord of the Universe. Thou didst assume the role of विष्णु for the protection of all worlds.

## 148 अनघो
Sinless . Though born in the midst of संसार (the material world). He is faultless, and so Anaghah. He is opposed to all sins.

## 149 विजयो
Victory incarnate. He is Vijaya. The creation and destruction of the world are successfully done by the other two gods (Brahma and rudra) because of His help. The conquest of the world depends on Him. So He is Vijaya. "Guided by Him in the right way. Brahma and rudra carry out the task of creation and destruction."

## 153 उपेन्द्रो
The brother of Indra. Next Comes उपेन्द्र the last of the sons of अदिति , and thus the younger brother of Indra. Vide "He is the last of the आदित्या-s and endowed with good qualities. O King! There are twelve sons of अदिति of whom Indra is the eldest. विष्णु is the last-born and the youngest of all in whom all the worlds have been firmly establiढed." "विष्णु became the younger brother of Indra." And so on.

## 154 वामनः
The dwarf. He is वामन who came to the Sacrifice of Bali for saving Indra. The Sruthi interprets 'वामन' as follows: ( वामानि-नयति), "By His effulgence He produces joy in those who see Him." "That वामना has a celestial and charming body."

## 155 प्रांशुः
The Tall. In the same place He became very tall. "The words 'kharu' 'sanku' etc. are irregularly formed by the 'ku' affix. The root 'As' (अस्नोति ) gets the 'affix' 'u' and a new letter 'num' (A+m+s+u = Amsuh). He is mentioned as 'All pervading" in the Manthra in praise of Him. Vide "When the water fell on His hand, Vँmana became ex-वामन (i.e.He became tall). As He measured the earth, the moon and the sun were on His chest. When He measured the ether with His foot. They were at His navel." "May that Vँmana protect you always who in a trice became Thrivikrama and measured all the three worlds by His foot and shone with sparkling weapons." And so on. The वेद with the beat of drums proclaims this great deed by saying "विष्णु measured this (earth)." "विष्णु measured with three steps." "This विष्णु measured this earth for getting the land (for Indra)" "The Lord measured the Earth in three steps." "प्रविष्णुः " so He is called the Supreme विष्णु

## 156 अमोघः
He who is never purposeless He is known as अमोघः since no act of His is purposeless. The Manthra is His eulogy says "To Him of Infinite greatness". That is because He blessed without difference both Bali and Indra." Vide "In a trice did He extend His sublime grace to Bali and give him a position equal to that of Indra. And He also enabled the gods to partake of the offerings made in a sacrifice." "Bali offered the water (in the hand of वामना ) and acquired lovable enjoyments. Even while remaining on the face of the Earth, he obtained the status of a god as well as the rulership of the gods for one full Manvanthara bereft of all enemies." And so on.

## 157 शुचिः
Pure. He is pure since He is शुचिः (Pure) since He does not expect anything in return for all the help He gives. The words 'ऋषी', 'अचि' and the like also come under this rule. After a verb ending in a consonant, but preceded by 'I' 'u' 'r' (long and short) and after the verbs 'ज्ञ', 'प्री' and 'कृ' comes the affix 'ka' (a)(suk + ka). "Unsullied as He is, the Superior Soul is pure."

## 158 ऊर्जितः
He who is endowed with strength. He is ऊर्जितः since, He is possessed of strength (ऊर्जा) as seen in the binding and killing of enemies like Mamuchi. The affix 'itach' has been added to ऊर्जा'.

## 159 अतीन्द्रः
He who excels Indra. He is अतीन्द्रः since He, though younger than Indra, surpasses Indra by His lordship and glorious acts. The Manthra about Him reads "To Him of inestimable greatness." "Him whose exploits surpass those of वायु and Indra."

## 160 संग्रहः
He who is easily reached. भगवान् can be reached without much effort by the devotees. The affix 'Ap' comes after the root 'grah', 'Vr', 'Dr', 'Nischi', and 'Gam'.

## 161 सर्गः
He who creates Himself. He is Sargah since He creates Himself so that His lotus feet which measured the three worlds may be easy to grasp. "He entrusts Himself to His friends."

## 162 धृतात्मा
The saviour of the Souls. By thus giving himself up, all the souls have been preserved by Him and so He is धृतात्मा.

## 163 नियमः
The controller. He is Niyamah since even powerful persons like Bali were controlled by Him. The root 'Yam' with the propositions 'Sam', 'Upa', 'Ni' and 'Vi' has affix 'Ap' added to it optionally. (ni + yam + a = niyamah).

## 164 यमः
The Ruler. His name is यमः since He rules all so that all of them are without trouble and happy. Vide "He who rules the earth from within". "He who rules the self from within." Such is the statement in अन्तर्यामी Brahma (भृहदारण्यक उपनिषद्) with reference to every one of the तत्वा-s (Realities). Vide "भगवान् controls all beings in the Universe from within the sphere of the Sun and He is the ruler over all. He is within your heart and if you have no quarrel with Him you need not go (on a piligrimage) to the Ganga or to कुरुक्षेत्र."

## 165 वेद्यो
He who can be realised. Thus He takes birth and reveals His greatness which otherwise cannot be cognised by the senses. Therefore He is वेद्यः He can be realised by all.

## 166 वैद्यः
The knower of Vidya or Knowledge. He is called Vaidyah, because He learns or knows the Vidya (knowledge) which removes the contact with the संसार of those who worship Him. The affix 'An' comes after a word denoting some subject of study in the sense of 'who has studied that' or 'who understands that' when it is the object of the verbs 'learns' or knows. Vide 'Heaps of sinful acts of a person even as big as मेरु and मन्दार mountains will perish if he resorts to केशव even as terrible diseases will perish by resorting to a physician."

## 167 सदा
योगी he who is ever wide awake. Thus भगवान् is ever awake when all are in slumber."

## 168 वीरहा
The slayer of storng men of wicked nature He is known as वीरहा He is the slayer of the disputatious men who put up fallacious arguments and who try to prevent men from meditating on Him. The suffix 'Kvip' is added to the root 'han' (to kill), with some nouns in the Accusative case. The rule that prescribes, this suffix to the words Brahman, Bhrओna and Vritha is only general and can be extended to others also like 'वीर'. The names कामाहा (295), क्रोधाहा (315), भगाहा (564) and the like have been similarly formed. "They say the Universe is unreal, without any foundation and without the Lord." The relevant section in गीता begins with this श्लोका and concludes with. "These haters, cruel, the worst ofmen and unholy, I throw continually into the cycles of birth and death, into none other than demoniacal wombs."

## 169 माधवो
The propounder of the knowledge of the Supreme being. He is माधवा since, He propounds the true knowledge about Himself as the Supreme Being, The knowledge of Hari is called 'मा'. Thou art the master of that knowledge. Therefore, Thou art known as माधव . It has been stated that 'Dhavah' means 'Lord'." "O भारत! Know that He is called माधव since He is endowed with mauna, (मा ), ध्यान (dha) and योग (va) (silence, meditation and practice)"

## 170 मधुः
Sweet like honey. He is called Madhu since He is sweet to those who have attained true knowledge. The affix 'u' and the augment 'gu' come after the roots 'phal', 'Pँth', 'Nam' 'Man' and 'Jan'. The word 'Madhu' is derived from the root 'Man' (to think) which takes the affix 'u' in the sense of being tasteful. 'Dha' is the substance for 'n'. "I am indeed inexpressily dear to the ज्ञानि (the man of wisdom)" The Six celestial Qualities of भगवान् .

## 171 अतीन्द्रियो
He who is beyond the range of the sense organs. Next the Sage proceeds to examine the essential nature of भगवान् who is sweet as the ocean of honey and endowed with qualities with the object of delineating the six important qualities which are the essence of the forms Para, व्यूह and वैभव. भगवान् is अतीन्द्रियाः , because He is beyond the range of the instruments of knowledge.

## 172 महामायः
He who is possessed of Maayaa or wonderful power of enchantment. How is He (said to be अतीन्द्रिय )? He has a great माया which like a curtain conceals Him and which charms the minds of all those in the world who are not devoted to Him. Vide "He is enveloped by the माया of the qualities." It will be shown later that this माया is not illusion.

## 173 महोत्साहो
He of great enthusiasm This name postulates the quality of lordship in भगवान् is distinguished from the ईश्वर of the Sankhya-system who though endowed with knowledge, is yet a non-doer of acts, who is lethargic and indifferent. भगवान् has a great Zeal for doing acts which signify His lordship. Because of this ardour for work भगवान् does all acts by a mere fraction of His independent will. There is no one above to direct Him. He is also skilful in creating newer and newer objects of enjoyment in countless numbers and sizes, the means and methods of experiencing them for the sake of persons in accordance with the nature of their कर्मा-s, big or small, experienced or yet to be experienced. Though He is omnipotent and independent He creates things endowed with qualities that are natural to them and possessed by them before. It is only a tiny part of an atom of a drop of His infinite ability that is seen in the capacity of Brahma and others to assume bodies of the size of an atom and so on.

## 174 महाबलः
He of immense strength. He is महाबलः (possessed of great strength) which distinguished Him from other agents who are always in need of external aasistance. Because of this strength He is never fatigued though engaged in unlimited activities. He stands firm on His own greatness and does not stand in need of external support. He bears all things without effort like His ever blossoming splendour which can never be checked. The Maulas state "He makes the many multitudinous." It is only a particle of this strength that is seen in water, air, earth and other things.

## 175 महाबुद्धिः
He of infinite knowledge. He is Maha-buddhih (possessed of great knowledge) to refute the school of thought which holds the view that the cause of the world is not omniscient. The Sage says. This omniscience of the Supreme Being is with reference to all objects far and near, in all places, at all times and of all nature. It is true because it is natural to Him and not tainted by pain; it is not the effect of Karma or desire. It does not stand in need of eye and other instruments of knowledge. If He uses His organs of sense, it is because of His free will. He is lotus-eyed and the hearer of what is pure and faultless. He may use His eyes to see and ears to hear. Nor is there any restriction that the रूप (form), rasa (taste) and the like can be cognised only by a particular sense-organs. It is well-known that the serpent amongst the creatures sees and hears with the eye alone. If that is the case (with the beings of lower strata) how will it be impossible for the Omnipotent God to do it? So has it been said in जयाख्य (Samhitha) "Just like the serpent which sees and hears with its eye, this (भगवान् ) can hear by all (His sense-organs)." His perception is direct and clear like the vision of the अमलक -fruit laid on the palm; and it is infallible since, He can accomplish any thing. Vide "He has eyes on all sides and faces on all sides." "He sees without eyes and hearts without ears." "He has everywhere eyes, heads and mouths" The venerable ँcharya Natthamuni has said: "Who sees directly by perception and of His own accord all things simultaneously." Some people spoke in contempt of the Omniscient Being by saying "If it is imagined on the basis of one instrument of knowledge that there is an omniscient being, then that being can as well grasp by the eye alone sweetness and all such objects of sense-organs." That is with reference to an omniscient being arrived at by inference (अनुमान) by the बौद्धा-s. For that is the context there. Otherwise it will be opposed to the शास्त्रा-s. "If you say that the eternity of the Supreme Being is only a praise, then it will amount to saying that it is not eternal." Similarly the omniscience propounded by the शास्त्रा-s will be nullified. Therefore the statement should be taken to signify something else or as incorrect. Moreover it is not correct to say that the statement in the शास्त्रा-s about the omniscience (of the Supreme being ) is fictitious and wrong; for we see in the world that in the case serpents and others of that species, in the case of crows, owls, eagles and other birds, in the case of men who have attained perfection in the mystic मन्त्रा-s, and in the case of those who are proficient in medicine and in the practice of austerities, there is some uniqueness in the functions of their sense-organs of knowledge in a greater or less degree. The same can be said of the wonderful nature of the other qualities of भगवान् . The knowledge in souls in bondage, released souls and Over-free Angels is but a small fraction of this quality of भगवान् .

## 176 महावीर्यो
He of great virility. भगवान् has the quality of great virility by virtue of which He remains unchanged though there may be a cause for change. This quality distinguishes Him from milk and other things which become transformed into curd etc. Like the smell of the A garu (tfee), the rust of animals, musk, flowers etc. He produces boundless effects by His very presence or by His vicinity. Vide "Smell by its very presence produces agitation in the mind without any other aid. So is परमात्म (the Supreme Lord.)" It is by a tiny part of this quality that the minds of the great योगिन्-s are ready and do not get distracted.

## 177 महाशक्तिः
Of immense power The name महाशक्तिः signifies that He has immense power to be the material and sentient cause as distinguished from the doctrine of the school of पाशुपता-s that ईश्वरा is only the sentient cause and not the material cause as well. This power brings about the production of all things at all times whether there are helpful accessories or not; it is capable of putting into use all the mean; it is capable of changing the Prakruthi which has been assumed as a part of His Body. When the capacity of Insects like spider and others to be not only the sentient cause but material cause also is undisputed, how can this power of an omniscient Supreme Being be a point of dispute? The change that is going on in प्रधाना (Primordial Matter) curd, milk etc. every moment, is due to a particle of this power of भगवान् .

## 178 महाद्युतिः
He of great splendour. The name महाद्युतिः indicates that He has a great splendour which distinguiढes Him from the other causes in the world which stand in need of assistance and that he does not require such a help. This effulgence is opposed to darkness (ignorance), both inner and outer and it is fascinating for those who are well-disposed and frightful for others. The lustre in the Sun, gem etc. is but a small drop of this. By the use of the adjective 'mahath' (great) in these six names (173-178) it is indicated that these qualities produced by a tiny part innumerable actions great and small, and the remaining parts remain unused since there is no scope for further action; and like the great rivers that flow towards the ocean carrying with them the excessive waters, these qualities shine in the भगवान् who is unlimited. Very well-known is this greatness of भगवान् . Vide "His supreme power is revealed, indeed, as being varied, natural and as being associated with knowledge, strength and action." "He is the unique collection of splendour, strength, sovereignty, great powers of knowledge, excellent heroism and other such qualities." "Knowledge, power, strength, lordship, heroism, splendourthese in all their entirely are expressed by the word ' भगवान्' and only evil (undesirable) qualities and other things are not." भगवत्- शास्त्रा-s (i.e.पञ्चरात्र संहिता-s) deal with this topic in all their entirely' Amiability, Love and other innumerable qualities also are treated as being included in these six qualities with a definite purpose.

## 179 अनिर्देश्यवपुः
He who is possessed of an indescribable body. He has a body endowed with these six qualities and so He is अनिर्देश्यवपुः Vide "The God who has a body endowed with six qualities and who has brilliance like that of glowing fire." This has been indicated in the मौल संहित also "In भगवान् we see intellect, mind, body and limbs. From the texts of the शास्त्रा-s also भगवान् is seen as being possessed of intellect, mind, body and limbs." "These who are possessed of intellect, mind, body and limbs, are beings whose bodies are formed by the seven great elements (mahath, अहंकार and पञ्च भूता-s). "Of what substance is the body of भगवान् composed?" A doubt is raised if भगवान् 's body also is composed of these elements; and the reply is given " भगवान् 's body is composed of भगवान् 's form itself." Of what is भगवान् Himself composed? He is knowledge incarnate, lordढip incarnate, power incarnate, like the glowing ember, of the burning khadira and silk-cotton trees that is fire on all sides, like pure honey, when drunk, that is fire on all sides, like pure honey, when drunk, that is sweet on all sides; like a bar of gold that is being polished is gold all round; and like a mansion that will be attractive when observed from all angles. Similarly भगवान् is entirely lordship and power in full. Whatever He wants to become He becomes. " This is going to be declared as the topic of पञ्चोपनिषद् (five upanishads). Just as the lustre of a gem is set off by a leaf of gold in the background, the splendour of भगवान् endowed with six qualities is only enhanced by Pure Saththvaguण, but not, concealed as is the case with other objects by the Thriguणa (i.e. Prakruthi composed of the three qualities सत्वा, रजस् and तमस् .) This is the truth about भगवान् ." विष्णु पुरुष says "Regarding His form, color etc. There is nothing that can be compared with them." That is to say His body is beyond comparison.

## 202 सिंहः
The lion. Who is like this? Simhah. भगवान् has assumed the great body of a man and a lion. "After the root 'sich' comes the affix 'ka' when the word derived from it denotes the name of a thing. The 'cha' of the root is replaced by 'ha' and there is also the 'num' augment.

## 206 अजः

He is also he conqueror of all."

## 207 दुर्मर्षणः

## 212 धाम

He has the Vaijayanthi Garland which is always associated with Him and which is indicative of supremacy. (Vaijayanthi the necklace of भगवान् विष्णु (composed of five gems, viz. Pearl, ruby, emerald, sapphire and diamond.) "After a stem ending in 'as', and after ' माया' and 'sraj' and मेधा comes the affix 'vini'."(Sraj + Vini -स्स्रग्वी).

## 218 वाचस्पतिः
The Lord of Speech. भगवान् is called वाचस्पतिः since, it was He Who propounded the meaning of the वेदा-s through श्रीमद् मत्स्य पुराण The genitive case termination of 'वाचः ' is not dropped.

## 219 उदारधीः
He of vast knowledge. By virtue of His omniscience भगवान् can be relied upon for help by all. So He is उदारधीः

## 220 अग्रणीः
The guide to a high place. Because of the quality mentioned above, भगवान् conducts all to the highest place viz. Parama-pada.

## 221 ग्रामणीः
He who is the leader of the hosts of Angels. There भगवान् leads the hosts of Ever-free Angels. So He is ग्रामणीः "The affix 'kvip' comes after the following verbs when in composition with a word ending in a case-affix though it may be an Upasarga; the verbs are 'sad', 'सू:', 'द्विष् ' 'नि' etc." The 'n' of the root 'ni' becomes the cerebral 'ख' by the rule"The dental 'n' is substituted by the cerebral 'ण' when it comes after 'agra' and 'ग्राम'.

## 222 श्रीमान्
He who is endowed woth wealth. This name clearly indicates that He is in possession of the Transcendental Glory and overlordship. Vide "Mathsya, the Lotus-eyed (in मत्स्य-अवतार )."

## 223 न्यायः
The just. He does what is just and proper and sees that nothing happens to the devotees which will be unwelcome or faulty. So He is न्याय . "The affix 'ghajn' comes after the roots 'ni' (to lead) and 'ई' (to go) when the prepositions 'pari' and 'ni' are respectively in composition with them and when the words so formed respectively mean a game and propriety or law."

## 224 नेता
He who carries out the commands of the devotees. He is नेता since, He is always in the habit of managing the affairs of His devotees. It is indeed quite proper that He dives deep into the sea and brings about the redemption of great souls.

## 225 समीरणः
He whose actions are delectable. In this way His activities are to His own liking and to that of His devotees; hence He is called समीरणः. The word 'समीरणः' is derived from the root 'ईर्' which means 'to move' or 'to shake'. The affix 'yuch' comes in the sense of the agent having such a habit etc. after intransitive verbs denoting motion or sound ('chalana-moving; 'ईर्'-going, or shaking). पवन (292) and other words also are formed by this rule. Here are some verses from the Scriptures as the authority for what has been said before. "भगवान् took the form of a Fish and at once proceeded to the रसातल -लोक (the Nether-world). He, the embodiment of the वेदा-s, brought from there the वेदा-s, to the place of Brahma. मत्स्य-अवतार (Fish Incarnation) should be meditated upon as follows : "He is adorned by knowledge and other numerous qualities in the form of fins and shines whith a proboscis shooting out like a horn. He has the intoxication of the Supreme Brahman rising out of Himself. "He has a body which is spotless like the white pearls and which carries at the end of the कल्पा-s (aeons) the vast Earth which is in the form of a boat and which has in it groups of प्रजापती-s (Secondary creators). And He has the form of a fiढ with unwinking eyes and closed mouth."

## 226 सहस्रमूर्धा
The thousand headed. The heads, eyes and feet mentioned in these names are to be interpreted as including all organs of knowledge and action as being implicit. The word 'Thousand' signifies that they are innumerable (and not only one thousand). That this is the meaning can be understood from the वेदिक् texts: "He has eyes on all sides." Learned scholars worthy of respect have declared that these words (eyes and hands and feet on all sides) signify that भगवान् is endowed with infinite capacity to know and act, which are the functions of those organs. Such an interpretation is not only appropriate, but also is in aggreement with many Sasthric texts.

## 227 विश्वात्मा
The All-pervading Deity. He is विश्वात्मा, because He pervades the entire Universe by His knowledge and strength. Vide - "He pervades the Earth in all its entirety."

## 228 सहस्राक्षः
The thousand eyed.

## 229 सहस्रपात्
The thousand footed.

## 230 आवर्तनः
He who turns the wheels of Samsara. Who turns (the wheel of संसार ). Since He whirls the wheel of संसार (material world) which is also like also a see-saw for raising water from a well, He is called आवर्तन . Vide "By Him is rotated this great wheel of संसार ." "Revolving all beings (as though mounted on a machine)." "भगवान् केशव is incessantly rotating by His Yogic powers the wheel of time, the wheel of the Universe and the wheel of the aeons (युगा-s)." "From Him was born the विराट् (Brahma, the cosmic पुरुष )." The same idea is corroborated by these and other texts.

## 231 निवृत्तात्मा
He whose Nature rises above other things. He has a personality which is superior, because He is the Master of the Transcendental Glory which is thrice the glory of the material world. Vide "The पुरुष stands eminent in the Parama-pada which is thrice (the material world)." "He is greater than the greatest, more exalted than the most exalted."

## 232 संवृतः
He who remains Hidden. In that state He is invisible to the unenlightened in whom the तमो गुणा predominates. So He is Samvruthah. Vide "Beyond darkness does He remain"

## 233 संप्रमर्दनः
The Dispeller. "He is Sampramardana, because He dispels the enveloping darkness by (the light of) His knowledge." "He who realises (i.e. meditates on) Him ( परमपुरुष ) thus, becomes immortal here." "Those who know Him thus become immortal where-as others (that do not know Him) go in for misery."

## 234 अहः
संवर्तको He who turns the day. He is the cause for the revolution of the day (and other divisions of Time). The affix 'nvul' has been added. "For 'yu' and 'vu' (nasalised) in an afffix ('yu' and 'nvul') are substituted respectively 'ana' and 'aka'. (Sam+vruth-nvulsamvruth+aka-Samvarthaka) "All moments (i.e. beings governed by the time element) were born out of the Radiant पुरुष ." "The wheel of time (He rotates)." "भगवान् alone controls Time etc." Time is always a toy for भगवान् . By its divisions into past, present and future, it is responsible for the knowledge of an object as old or young. He controls it which brings about the union or separation of Prakruthi and पुरुष (Matter and Soul). It is also the cause of the six kinds of transmutations of Prakruthi (viz. Birth, existence, change, growth, decay and finally death). Some say that Time is only the series of the transmutations of Prakruthi (Matter) in a fixed order. Others opine that it is the sum-total of the activities of परमेश्वर . Yet others are of the view that Time is an independent entity. The passage in the पौष्कर संहित should be suitably interpreted. (Here is the passage.) "अध्यात्मा refers to Time, the Reality. आदि -daivam is Paramathma, who is the Inner Soul of the Universe and Whose form is the cause of its creation and destruction.आदि-भूत should be understood as the three worlds composed of the five elements (Pancha-bhu:tha). Time in this world of Avyaktha-thaththva is in the form of अध्यात्मा. आदि-दैवम् is 'इज्या ' (worship). आदि-भूत is true enjoyment."

## 235 वह्निः
The Bearer. Since, भगवान् bears the Universe in the form of space. He is called वह्निः. The word 'vahni' is formed by the following grammatical rule : "The affix 'nith' comes after the roots 'vah', 'sri', 'yu', 'dru', 'glai', 'हा' and 'thvar'. (Vah+ni=Vahnih). The foremost space is Parama-आकाश (the Supreme Abode). Others like the sky, directions etc. are space only relatively and they are but a tiny corner in that foremost space. Vide "The eternal (three parts of the पुरुष viz.नारायण ) are in the Heavens (Paramapada)." "That rests on its own greatness." "After (वासुदेव and other forms) the fourth part (viz. Ani-ruddha by name) came out in this world." That thing is called space which is the cause of the comprehension of an object as 'this' and 'here'. And that is the gift of भगवान् to all the souls in bondage, the released souls, and the Ever-free souls (नित्या-s).

## 236 अनिलः
The Giver of life-breath. भगवान् is called Anila since, He alone bestows the life-breath on all. The well-known wind is only a tiny fraction of this Anila viz. भगवान् "The wind was born out of His breath." "Who ever can breathe and who ever can live if the आकाश (viz. परमात्मा ) were not there?" "The affix ilach comes after the roots 'sal', 'kal' and 'an' (to live). (An+ilach=anilah).

## 237 धरणीधरः
The bearer of the earth. He bears all (like आदिशेष , भूमि etc). who bear others. Vide :- "He bore the Earth and the Heaven." "पुरुषोत्तम, by His will, created the Earth, the Interspace and the Heaven; being the Supreme ruler, He keeps them all under His control." And other texts like these.

## 238 सुप्रसादः
The conferror of favours. He is called सुप्रसादः since, He does all good as stated above to His devotees who are well-disposed towards Him. Vide - "By the Grace of the Creator who is immensely great and who is not tainted by evil, the devotee becomes free from all sorrows and sees Him." "The two Lords (बलराम and कृष्ण), who shower immense favour, have come to my hut"-(said the garland-maker)."

## 239 प्रसन्नात्मा
The clear minded. The reason for being सुप्रसादः is shown by this name प्रसन्नात्मा . भगवान् has got all things desirable by Himself, and therefore His mind is not affected by desire and other things. Vide "He is without hunger for food and thirst for drink, and His desires are true and His will also is true." "He is peace in its entirety and is nectar." "That person cannot at all be pleased who is in wants and who is a miser."

## 240 विश्वसृट्
The creator of the Unverse. भगवान् creates the Universe out of kindness unmindful of its merits or defects.

## 241 विश्वभुक्
विभुः He who pervades all things and protects them. Thus भगवान् pervades the Universe and protects it. (भुनक्ति-पालयति (protects.) This is one name (and not two). Vide -- "The Omniscient भगवान् creates the bodies, gives them names, and utters them."

## 242 सत्कर्ता
He who honours the good. He honours those who are good as a matter of course since, it is His habit to do good to even ordinary people who pay no attention to him. This is in accordance with the maxim known as 'दण्ड-अपूपिक '. (दण्ड-अपूपिक-न्याय - The maxim of the stick and the cakes. Some cakes are kept in the kitchen at night and to drive away the rats, a stick also is kept beside them. When one comes and reports in the morning that the stick has been eaten away by the rats at night, we are naturally led to expect that the cakes also should have been eaten away by the rats as a matter of course. Since both of them have been-kept together.)

## 243 सत्कृतः
He who is worshipped. भगवान् is worshipped by the good. He is immensely pleased with even the little that is offerred to Him by them with devotion as though it is something great and sulted to His greatness, and feels that there is nothing that He can do for them in return. Vide "It is really wonderful. भगवान् Hari pleases all those who are exclusively devoted to Him; and He Himself receives with His head the worship offered by them to Him in accordance with the शास्त्रा-s." "By Sabari (the forest-woman), He (राम ) was worshipped well."

## 244 साधुः
He who carries out what. भगवान् is साधुः since He carries out whatever they want Him to do, for example going as a messenger, acting as a charioteer etc. "The affix 'un' comes after the roots 'kri', 'वा', 'पा', 'ji' and 'साध' (to accomplis). साध +u=साधुः (the literal) meaning of which is 'one who accomplishes the work of another.

## 245 जह्नुः
The concealer. The word 'Jahnu' has been derived from the root 'हा' (to forsake.) He is 'Jahnu' because He conceals His greatness from the non-devotees. This is the interpretation given by the Etymologists. In उद्योग पर्व It is said "That Discus of the omni-present वासुदेव acts by His will for the benefit of the पाण्डवास् being Invisible (to the eyes of others), O Great King!"

## 246 नारायणो
The Support of the host of souls. Sage व्यास next, gives the special name of the परमात्मा, नारायण, who has been spoken of by the various names mentioned hitherto and also particularly by the उपनिषद्-s in every one of the various branches of the वेदा-s. This name signifies the परमात्मा (the Supreme Being) as distinguished from His own other forms (i.e. Incarnations). Here are some वेदिक् texts : "We meditate on नारायण ." "नारायण is the Supreme Brahman." "Verily only one viz. नारायण was there." "Then again there was the same नारायण ." "नारायण is the eye and the object seen." "Then there was the celestial Deity,नारायण ." The वेद itself gives the derivation of the name नारायण a thus : "Whatever object there is in the Universe which is seen or heard, नारायण remains pervading all that, both inside and outside." More than this we do not say since it is something that should not be seen by six eyes i.e. a secret that can be known only by four eyes, (two eyes of the teacher on the one hand and two of the pupil on the other).

## 247 नरः
He who is imperishable. The same (i.e. the word नारायण is explained in a mystic way by this name 'Narah' which means He has imperishable possessions, the sentient and the non-sentient (both of which are eternal by nature).

## 248 असङ्ख्येयः
He is Nara (the Innumerable), since the hosts of things mentioned above are also numberless.

## 249 अऽप्रमेयात्मा
He of immeasurable nature. भगवान् is अऽप्रमेयात्मा because He pervades inside and outside the numberless things which are limitless and are too numerous to be grasped one by one.

## 250 विशिष्टः
He who is superior. He is of an exalted nature by Himself and has not to depend on any one else.

## 251 शिष्टकृत्
He who makes all persons eminent.

## 252 शुचिः
He who is pure. By His contact with others, भगवान् makes them become endowed with auspicious qualities and fit to be with Him. He has an effulgence which is natural to Him and not bestowed on Him by others. (Bhattar comments on these two names together and not one after another as in the case of other names.)

## 253 सिद्धार्थः
He who is in possession of all desirable things. This name 'सिद्धार्थः' substantiates all that has been said about Him before and says that all things desirable are already with Him.

## 254 सिद्धसंङ्कल्पः
He of infallible will and determination. Over and above what has been stated about Him. His wills are always true and unfailing. Since, He is independent (and not under the control of another), when He wishes to get anything, He attains it without fail at once. Vide "He Whose wishes are true (i.e. always realised), and Whose wills are ever true (i.e. unfailingly accomplished).

## 255 सिद्धिदः
The bestower of Siddhis or superhuman powers. He confers superhuman power on those who strive for them by resorting to Himpowers like 'अणिम' (power of acquiring the size of an atom), 'garimँ' (power of acquiring weight, immeasurable size), etc. The siddhis are eight in number; 'अणिम'power of assuming the size of an atom; 'महिमा'-power of assuming an immeasurable size; 'लखिमा'-power to become very light; 'गरिमा '-power to become very heavy; 'प्राप्ती'-the power of obtaining anything; 'प्रकाम्यम्'-irresistible will; 'इसिता ' superiority; 'वसिता '-subjugation.)

## 256 सिद्धिसाधनः
H who makes the means as pleasant as the goal. भगवान् is सिद्धिसाधनः , because He makes the means (meditation on Him) also pleasant in its process like the fruit itself. This is in line with the statement in the गीता : "Those who adopt this (discipline of devotion) which is in accordance with virtuous conduct and which is sweet like nectar, are exceedingly dear to me."

## 257 वृषाही
He who has the day which is Dharma auspicious. He is called वृषाही, because the day on which a devotee first approaches the Lord, is itself a day of virtue (वृष-means dharma) since, it is the day on which the inauguration is made for the flow of all auspiciousness. "The affix 'thach' is added to the words 'राजन् ', 'ahan' and 'sakhin' when standing at the end of a तत्पुरुष Compound." The name वृषी signifies that He has such a day of वृषा to be given to us. Vide :-- "Today I am going to see the face of विष्णु which has eyes lovely like full-blown lotuses. Therefore my birth has become fruitful this day and this is an auspicious dawn for my night." "Nights they were (when I had no vision of भगवान् ) and days are these (when I am beside Him)." "When a person takes his stand in God who is Adrusya (invisible or inscrutable), then he becomes bereft of fear (i.e. संसार ).

## 258 वृषभो
He who showers His grace He pours forth His grace on those who approach Him and who are scorched by the fire of संसार "The affix 'abhach' comes after the roots 'ruष्' (to go) and 'वृष' (to sprinkle), and it is treated as having 'कित् '."

## 259 विष्णुः
The pervader. He is विष्णुः since He pervades (all things) showering (His grace). The word 'विष्णुः ' is derived from the root 'विष्ल्' (to pervade). It takes the suffix 'nu' as well as 'kith'. Here the 'व्यापती' (pervasion) is to be taken as signifying the 'व्यापती' of the school of Tharka (Indian Logic). According to that school 'व्यापती' is concordance as in the case of fire and smoke. Wherever there is smoke, there is fire. But fire is greater, because it exists in places where there is no smoke e.g. a red-hot ball of iron. In the same way there is inseparable connection between भगवान् and others, but He is greater by virtue of the diverse kinds of help He renders to all who are of a lower order. Vide : "There is no object, moving or non-moving, which can exist without Me."

## 260 वृषपर्वा
He who has Dharma as steps (for His attainment). वृषा-s are the various dharmas that pertain to the different वर्णा-s and आश्रमा-s (castes and stages of life). They are like the stops of a ladder to reach Him. So He is वृषपर्वा

## 261 वृषोदरः
He who has righteous belly. भगवान् has धर्म itself for His belly which can be easily filled by the oblations acquired and offered by His worshippers; or He is वृषोदरः since He keeps those in distress in His belly and protects them, when they resort to Him.

## 262 वर्धनः
He who nourishes. He is called Vardhana, becauses like a mother, He keeps them in His womb and nourishes them.

## 263 वर्धमानः
He who grows. He is वर्धमानः : He grows as He makes others grow. Or His growth does not stop with such help only. He makes all more and more prosperous.

## 264 विविक्तः
He who is Unique. All His activities are extra-ordinary and are superior to those of others in the world. So He is called विविक्तः.

## 265 श्रुतिसागरः
He who is the sea for the Vedas. He is the final receptacle for all the वेदा-s which are replete with His qualities, delineated above and which end in Him even as the ocean is the last resort of the waters of the flowing rivers. Vide; "The वेदा-s speak only about नारायण." "I am the only one that is to be realised by all the वेदा-s'This is what कृष्ण says in the गीता .

## 266 सुभुजः
He of lofty arms. भगवान् has auspicious arms which are ever bent upon shouldering the burden of those that seek refuge in Him.

## 267 दुर्धरो
The irresistble. By virtue of the strength of such arms.भगवान् is endowed with such an irresistible power like the force of the gushing waters of the great sea at the time of Deluge which cannot be resisted by the bridge of sand built by children for sport. "In the sense of hard and difficult, or light and easy, the affix 'khal' is added to a verb when 'ईषद् ', 'dur' and 'su' are combined with it as an 'upapada' (particle). The names 'Durlabhah' (783) and 'Durgamah' (784) are formed similarly.

## 268 वाग्मी
He Who is the worthy object of words of praise. He is वाग्मी since, He has words (the वेदा-s) which are highly worthy of praise. The affix 'gmini' comes after the word 'वाच् ' in the sense of 'matup' (i.e. possession). The praise-worthiness here is due to the fact that He is proficient in words and is the embodiment of the वेदा-s which bring Him success (in argument), and which are sweet, majestic, kind and beneficient. Vide; "The वेदा-s are but words expressed (by Him)." "He (रामा ) is proficient in giving ready replies to arguments put forward (by others), and in this He is like बृहस्पती , (the Lord of speech)." "Speak again; for I am not satiated by hearing such words of nectar." "रामा is wise and speaks sweet words: He is the first to speak and also speaks kind words." "He narrates the episode of the भारता-s and the श्रिञ्जय-s which is praise-worthy, which confers happiness, which is commendable, which is comprehensible to those desirous of Release, and incomprehensible to the lifeless (who are ill-disposed)." "The Lotus-eyed Lord (कृष्ण) took hold of the long hand of the king and spoke in a voice like the thunder of a timely showering cloud, words which were serious, but not frightening, which were agreeable and clear." And so on.

## 269 महेन्द्रः
he of great wealth. Since, भगवान् pervades thus on all sides, He has supreme overlordship which is worthy of respect and He is called Mahendra. The word Indra is derived from the root 'idi' (to own grea wealth). "The words 'rijra', 'indra' etc. are irregularly formed with the affix 'ra'. (idi+ra=Indra).

## 270 वसुदः
The Wealth-giver. Even though भगवान् has supreme overlordship, which is unassailable by virtue of His being the Mahendra (the great Lord of wealth). He bestows the wealth on the needy even though they are insignificant people. Vide : "The supreme Deity confers the three worlds and Kubera the riches".

## 271 वसुः
Wealth. He is Vasu since He is Himself the wealth for great men as stated in the गीत : "वासुदेव is everything."

## 272 नैकरूपः
He of multifarious forms. Next the Cosmic nature of भगवान् is dealt with which is in consonance with the greatness delineated above : भगवान् is in diverse forms as a result of which it is quite appropriate to His being cognised as all those things themselves. "The negative particle 'na' remains unchanged in 'नभ्राज ' 'नपात्' and other words". The words given in this rule are only by way of an example and so the word 'नैकरूप ' also may be included in that list. Or it may come under the rule that the negative particle has two alternative forms, one as 'na' and the other as 'a'. Here 'na' remains in the same form. The word 'नैक-माय' (303) also comes under this rule. The Manthra for His meditation is "Unto Him of multifarious forms." "I see Thee everywhere with Thy endless forms".

## 273 बृहद्रूपः
He of an immense form. Every one of these forms of His is so big as to prevade the space in all the quarters and the sky. So He is बृहद्रूपः. Vide : "By Thee alone is pervaded the interspace between the Earth and the Heaven as well as all the directions."

## 274 शिपिविष्टः
He Who pervades the rays. 'Sipi' means rays and 'विष्टः ' means 'has entered'. He has pervaded all the rays. Yaska in his Niruktha says : "Sipayah are said to signify the 'rays', and they have entered into Him." There is also a similar interpretation by the ancients : "The meaning of the word ' शिपिविष्टः' is : He has tawny hairs on His body; with that body He has pervaded all other things. So He is ' शिपिविष्टः ". In the उद्योग पर्व (महाभारत) "That is ' शिपिविष्टः ' which enters into the pores of the body like the rays of the Sun." "Thy powerful rays are filling the whole Universe and are burning it."

## 275 प्रकाशनः
He who shows. भगवान् shows this celestial form to Arjuna and others who long to see it. So He is called प्रकाशनः . Vide : "I shall give you a divine eye . See the sovereign powers I am endowed with." "This form of Mine you have seen which is very difficult to see."

## 276 ओजस्तेजो-द्युतिधरः
He who endowed with strenght, vigour and brilliance. 'ओजस् ' signifies strength; 'तेजस् ' means reputation or power to overcome enemies; and 'Dyuthi' is effulgence. Since, Bhagavँn alone has all these. He is 'ओजस्तेजो-द्युतिधरः'. This is one name. "Just as moths with accelerated speed enter a blazing fire for their own destruction. (so too these men enter Thy mouth with great velocity for their destruction)." "O हृषीकेश I ( कृष्ण I) Quite properly does the world rejoice at Thy reputation (and is drawn towards Thee)." "If the effulgence of a thousand Suns were to rise up simultaneously in the sky, (then it would be somewhat like the splendour of that Mighty One (श्री कृष्ण )" (Sanjaya said.) And so on.

## 277 प्रकाशात्मा
He of a nature that is well known to all. His supreme power is admitted even by fools. So He is प्रकाशात्मा धृतराष्ट्र also says the same "O Lotus-eyed Lord! Thou art the master of the entire Universe. Therefore Thou shouldst take pity on me, O the Chief of the यादवास् !"

## 278 प्रतापनः
He who scroches.

## 279 ऋद्धः
He Who is plentiful and magnificient. भगवान् is ऋद्धः (plentiful) like the ocean on a full-moon day which submerges even the shore (with its rising waves). In the उद्योग पर्व it is said : "Then that foremost person among all men spoke again words that were divine and wonderful, artistic and magnificent."

## 280 स्पष्टाक्षरो
He of clear words. The letters of the words (and words) of the वेदा-s have been made clear by virtue of this magnificence which is the topic of those वेदा-s.

## 281 मन्त्रः
The mystic word. The etymologists interpret the word thus : "तन्मन्तारं त्रायते इति मन्त्रः" Manthra is that which protects him who meditates on it." In the Brahma पुराण in the context of the praise of भगवान् to drive away the wicked, Sage नारद puts the following question to भगवान् : "O मधुसूदन ! Who can remember Thee at that time when his life departs?" The reply of भगवान् is : "He, who thinks of me always, will certainly cross this vast and frightful sea of संसार which is filled with the waters of greed and avarice." (The वराह -charama श्लोक also says) "The man who, when his mind is in its normal condition, when the body is not shattered, and when the elementary constituents of the body (धातू-s) are in perfect equipoise, meditates on me who have the world as My body and who am not subject to births due to Karmawhen that man lies like a log of wood or a piece of stone in his dying moments, I think of (him) My devotee and lead him to attain the Supreme Abode.

## 282 चन्द्रांशुः
He who is possessed of effulgent rays like those of the moon. भगवान् possesses an effulgence which dispels the distress of the meditators and fills them with joy. So He is called 'चन्द्रांशुः'. Vide : "The sages in the forest saw रामा who was like the rising moon." And so on.The word 'chandra' is derived from the root 'chad' (to delight). "The affix 'rak' comes after (thirty-two) roots beginning with 'स्पायी', 'thanchi', and 'chadi', 'Chandra' is formed according to this rule.

## 283 भास्करद्युतिः
He who has the refulgence of the sun. भगवान् is endowed with a brilliance which easily throws others in the shade. So He is भास्करद्युतिःi. Vide : "The frightened राक्षसा-s melt away in all directions." "O Monkey (Hanuman)! The Sun-like रामा, who is valiant and who has heaps of ray-like arrows, will certainly dry up the water viz. The inimical राक्षसा-s." Here is a slओka which describes भगवान् both as the formidable Sun and the delightful moon : "This Lord श्री कृष्ण, who is the ruler of all the worlds, is thus a source of terror to the असुरा-s and of protection to the gods on all sides."

## 284 अमृतांशूद्भवः
The source of the nectar-rayed moon. The moon has got rays of nectar which dispel all heat which nourish the plants and which bring back to life even the dead. The moon has acquired this quality because of her close contact with the mind of भगवान् which has coolness and other lovable qualities. The वेदिc Manthra says : "The Moon was born out of the mind of महा पुरुष (i.e. भगवान् नारायण )."

## 285 भानुः
The lustrous Sun. भगवान् is भानुः, because He has an effulgence by acquiring which even the thousand-rayed bright sun shines. "The Sun has taken the effulgence of भगवान् and shines".

## 286 शशबिन्दुः
He who disowns the evil-minded. Similarly He is शशबिन्दुः. He disowns those who go in the wrong path. The word 'Sasi' is derived from the root 'शश' (to jump or swerve from the right path); and 'bindu' from 'bidi' (to disown). The words 'bindu' and 'icchu' have been irregularly formed and end with the affix 'u'.

## 287 सुरेश्वरः
The lord of gods. Similarly भगवान् is the Lord of those who go in the right path. This is in consonance with the saying : "Whatever is crooked (in conduct) leads to death (संसार ); whatever is straight leads to the attainment of Brahman."

## 288 औषधं
The medicine. By virtue of His power to remove the great poison viz, संसार , भगवान् is called 'औषधं '. Vide : "The gods and the celestial sages know Him to be the remedy for distress." "O भगवान् ! Thou alone art verily the recipe for the संसार, which (recipe) can be obtained by the high price of the concentration of the mind on Thee."

## 289 जगतः
सेतुः The barrier of universe. भगवान् is called 'जगतः सेतुः', because He is the barrier which keeps apart the mixing up of the good and the bad. Vide : "He is the bridge that supports all the worlds so that they may not get into confusion." It is because of this there is no occasion for the attainment of fruit for actions not begun or for the non-attainment of fruits for actions completed. "Just as the calf recognises and reaches its mother in the midst of a thousand cows, similarly, the effect of an act committed previously by a person goes to him." "The doer of good deeds obtains happiness, whereas the doer of sinful acts obtains sin and suffers from it."

## 290 सत्य-धर्म-पराक्रमः
He whose qualities and valour are true. Here 'Dharma' signifies the auspicious qualities of भगवान् , and 'पराक्रम' His exploits. All of them are always true and never go in vain. So He is सत्य-धर्म-पराक्रमः Beginning to speak of the qualities and acts of कृष्ण, Arjuna says in the गीत : "O कृष्ण! I consider all that you tell me to be true." "विष्णु has prowess that is true and unfailing." "In वाका-s and अनुवाका-s, निषाद्-s and उपनिषद्-s, as well as in the true Sama Hymns, they declare that His acts are ever true, and He is Truth itself." (The वाका,अनुवाक etc, refer to the different sections and chapters of the Veda.)

## 291 भूतभव्यभवन्नाथः
The lord of all in the past, future and present. He is the master and overlord of all things not only in the present, but at all timespast, present and future.

## 292 पवनः
He Who moves about (Wind) भगवान् is called पवन since by nature He moves about in all places and at all times. The wind (the bearer of fragrance) is called 'sathatha-gathi' (constant wanderer) because it has just a fraction of this quality of भगवान् . The word 'pavanah' is derived from the root 'pavi' (to move about

## 293 पावनः
The purifier. He is पावन since, He makes the Ganga and the like that are connected with Him purify the world. Agasthya says to राम . "O the Scion of the Raghu race I, Thou alone art the purifier of all the worlds."

## 294 अनलः
He Who is insatiate. Even though भगवान् has thus done good in several ways, still He is insatiate. (Analah). Such is the greatness of His benevolence. He is the god who is never tired of doing good. The fire in the world is called 'anala' (insatiate) only because of the possession of a particle of this great quality of being insatiable (by fuel). "Like the fire that grows by the sacrificial offerings, He grows more and more."

## 295 कामहा
The destroyer of desires. भगवान् 's name is कामहा , because He destroys the desires for worldly pleasures of those who have realised the nature of His qualities as described above. "My mind is free from the stain of desires. So it has secured a place at Thy feet." These are the words of those that have realised Him. "One who is well-versed in the वेदा-s and not vitiated by desires (attains the Bliss of Brahman)." "Desirous of attaining Whom (भगवान् ), they practise celibacy."

## 296 कामकृत्
The creator of desirable things. Moreover He creates objects fit to be enjoyed here, salvation etc. So He is कामकृत् .

## 297 कान्तः
He who is charming. He is कान्तः (fascinating by the qualities of His body like loveliness and delicacy. The word 'कान्तः' is the past participle of the root 'kam' (to desire). The penultimate letter 'a' of 'kam' is lengthened by the rule which says "The penultimate vowel of a root ending with a nasal becomes long when followed by the affix 'kvip' and before an affix having an indicatory 'ka' or 'gn' which begins with a consonant other than a semi-vowel or nasal. (kam+tha=कान्तः).

## 298 कामः
The Lovable or Manmatha. भगवान् is also extremely lovable by virtue of His innate qualities like amiability, generosity and compassion. By an iota of this quality, Manmattha, the god of love, maddens the whole world.

"The affix 'ka' comes after a root having the form of 'दा' and 'ज्ञा' when taking the preposition 'pra' and in composition with a word in the Accusative case. The name 'Vasupradah' (698 and 699) also has been similarly formed.

## 300 प्रभुः

The creator of the beginning of the Yuga. Next the limitless nature of भगवान् is dealt with. Amongst His Incarnations that in which He reclines on the leaf of a banyan tree (वट-पत्र-शायी अवतार ) is given as an example. Even at the end of a Yuga, He makes the beginning of another युगादिकृत् . Even at the periodical dissolution of the Universe. He saved it from the distress of Deluge and began the Universe again.

## 302 युगावर्तो
He Who revolves the aeons. He makes the Krutha and other युगा-s go round again and again associated with their respective धर्मा-s. He is युगावर्तो.

## 303 नैकमायः
He of multifarious wonders. भगवान् is नैकमायाः by virtue of the innumerable, inscrutable and wonderful exploits of His like being an artless and charming infant, swallowing unlimited number of worlds and lying on the leaf of a banyan tree unsupported in the waters of the Ocean. The word 'माया' here is not used in the sense of illusion; because its usage in the sense of 'truth' also is found in many places. Vide : "Know that माया is Prakruthi". Here Prakruthi signifies the Primordial Matter which is the source for the creation of many objects. "माया, Vayunam, ज्ञानम् "all signify knowledge. "Thou knowest all the means for realising the fourfold ends of life." In all these places the word "माया is used in the sense of knowledge. In विष्णु पुराण it is used to signify a real substance that cannot be dispelled by correct knowledge and which is destroyed by means of arrows. Vide : "Thousands of that माया of Sambara Asura were destroyed one by one by the swift-moving discus (of विष्णु (which came to protect the body of the boy (प्रह्लाद)", (If the word 'माय' here means 'illusion', it could have been destroyed only by correct knowledge and not by the discus as stated here). In the Chapter on the माया in the वराह पुराण माया' is used in the sense of the wonderful exploits of विष्णु . "The appearance of the cloud, the return of the waves of the ocean (after touching the shore), the waxing and waning of the Moon, the blasts of wind, the flash of the lightning, the movement of the hot-rayed sunall these are the various wonderful acts (माया-s) of विष्णु." Learned men have explained 'माया' as 'great wonder'. Sage मार्कणडेय describes in the अरण्य पर्व (of महाभारत) the marvellous act of विष्णु when he sees Him lying on the leaf of a banyan tree and says : "O King! I was struck with great wonder when I saw the entire world (in the belly of विष्णु)."&&& "After speaking a few words thus, the highly wonderful God disappeared, O, the foremost of the भारता-s! How marvellous it is!". Thus with reference to the word 'माया' there is an abundance of usage in well-known and faultless texts in the sense of 'highly wonderful'.

## 304 महाशनः
He who is a voracioud eater. He is महासना , because He swallows the entire Universe. Vide "Whatever moving and non-moving objects were seen by me in the world, I saw all of them in the belly of that great भगवान् ."

## 305 अदृश्यः
He who cannot be seen. The actions of भगवान् are really unscrutable. Vide : "When the entire world has met with destruction, where and how does this infant lie? Even though I try to know this by the power of my austerities, I am not able to understand this infant." "After verbs having a penultimate short 'ri' the affix 'kyap' is employed with the exception of the two roots 'klip' and 'chrith'."

## 312 शिखण्डी
He who has the plume of lordship. भगवान् is endowed with an effulgence signifying His limitless and unassilable lordship. So He is called शिखण्डी .

## 313 नहुषः
He who binds. Bhagavan binds the Jivas by His Maya. भगवान् binds the जीवा-s by His माया . The etymologists intarpret the word thus : 'nahyathi (binds) ithi नहुषः'. "In that, another being (viz. जीव ) is bound down by माया (the Primordial Matter)."

## 314 वृषः
He Who drenches. The selfsame Lord, by His nectar-like effulgence and words, Drenches him who is fatigued by wandering in the midst of the sea (of संसार ) and consoles him. So He is called Vrushah.

## 320 अच्युतः

"That which is denoted by प्राण (life) (Indra and other such words is Brahman) because it is so understood from the sequel."

## 323 प्राणदो

"The affix 'da' comes after the verb 'jan' (to be born) with a past signification when the root takes the preposition 'anu' and is compounded with a word in the Accusative Case." (वासवम् अनु जातः =वासवानुजः ).

## 325 अपां
निधिः The sustainer of the waters of the great Ocean. भगवान् is अपां निधिः, because He sustained the great Ocean when it was being churned.

## 326 अधिष्ठानम्
The support. "O Great Sage! He was the support for the Mandara mountain when it was revolving (at the time of churning)." So He is called अधिष्ठानम् .

## 327 अप्रमत्तः
The Vigilant. He is extremely careful and attentive (अप्रमत्त) in the protection of those who are in distress.

## 328 प्रतिष्ठितः
He who is self-dependent. He depends on His own greatness without looking for help from others. So He is प्रतिष्ठितः To the question "Where is भगवान् firmly established?", the reply is "In His own greatness". "The Lord Who rests on His own greatness."

## 329 स्कन्दः
He Who dries up i.e dstroys. He himself destroys the Asuras and other evil doers. So He is स्कन्दः

## 330 स्कन्दधरः
The Supporter of स्कन्दः भगवान् is the supporter of स्कन्द, the Commander-in-chief of the army of gods. Skanda also is a part of His विभूति (or glory). Vide : "I am Skanda among the commanders of armies."

## 331 धुर्यो
The Chief or prop. भगवान् is the support as the मन्त्र says : "Unto Him Who bears the world". So He is धुर्यो "The affixes 'yath' and 'dhak' come in the sense of 'what bears it after the word 'dhura' in the second case in construction.

## 332 वरदः
The Grantor of boons. He is वरदः, because He bestows the required boons on the gods and others who have got to carry on the affairs of the world.

## 333 वायुवाहनः
He who has vayu as his vehicle. भगवान् rides on and drives वायु (Air) who is the life-breath of the world. So He is वायुवाहनः

## 334 वासुदेवः
He who pervades and sports. भगवान् is 'वासुः ' and ' देवः '. He is वासु since He lives in the world making it live within Himself like a mother and also protects it by covering it like a bird that protects its young ones with its out-spread wings. (The word 'वासुः' is derived from the root 'vas' (to reside and to envelope). He is 'देवः ', because He plays, wishes to conquer, and again shines; He is eulogised and goes (to His devotees). (The root 'div' from which the word 'deva' is derived has got several meanings-to sport, wish to conquer, to shine, to praise, to feel happy, to dream, to glitter and to go.) The ancient seers have interpreted the name वासुदेव thus : "Like the Sun that covers the entire world with his rays. I also cover the world and I am the abode of all beings. So I am called वासुदेव." "I am the abode of all beings and with a divine form live in all of them. Therefore I am known as वासुदेव and am referred to as such." "Learned men declare that भगवान् is called वासुदेव, because He abides in all things and all things abide in Him." Such is the statement in all शास्त्रा-s about Him. We do not write anything more explicitly since it is a secret (and has to be learnt from a preceptor).

## 335 बृहद्भानुः
He of profuse lustre. With a desire to explain further the sage proceeds to say : The name बृहद्भानुः signifies that He shines by virtue of His world of Enjoyment. He has eternal and radiant rays.

## 336 अदिदेवः
The First Deity. That He sports with the worlds that are inferior to Him is described by the name अदिदेवः. Vide "भगवान् , the Lord, plays with the world creating and destroying it as He pleases."

Like a child playing with its toys, He plays with the beings in the world (and enjoys the लीला )."

## 337 पुरन्दरः
The destroyer of cities. By the four names beginning with this, the warding off of troubles caused by wicked persons by भगवान् is described. He is Purandara, because He destroyed the cities of the Asurँs. This indicates the removal of the fear from the असुरा, पिशाचास् (i.e. ghosts), thunder and lightning, planets and other troubles which go by the name of 'आदि-दैविक ' (those that proceed from the gods). "The words 'वाचंयम' and 'पुरन्दर ' are irregularly formed.

## 338 अशोकः
The dispeller of sorrows. He is the remover of sorrow, delusion, hunger and other bodily troubles of all beings-the troubles which go by the name of 'अध्यात्मिक '. So He is अशोक.

## 339 तारणः

## 340 तारः
The Saviour. Bhagavan is called Taarah, because by his very presence He saves all from the fears of Samsara. भगवान् is called तारः , because by His very presence He saves all from the fears of संसार . In अथर्व शिर-s the Manthra is : "He makes all cross over the great fears of the sea of संसार comprising conception, birth, old age and death. Therefore He is called 'Thँra'." "He is devoid of sins, and bereft of old age and death." This and other such Vedic texts are appropriate to the context.

## 341 शूरः
The Valiant. By the name 'शूरः' the quality of having a desire for victory is signified. He is 'डःra' because he is capable of attaining victory. The word 'शूरः' is derived from the root 'शु' (to go). "The affix 'kran' comes after 'su', 'si', 'chi', and 'mi' and there is also the lengthening of the vowel of the root. (शु+u+ra=शुर.)

## 342 शौरिः
The son of Soora (Vasudeva). शौरिः indicates that special quality because of which He goes toward s His devotees. He is the son of the valiant वासुदेव . "The affix 'इञ्' comes after a norminal stem which ends in short 'a' in denoting a descendant."

## 343 जनेश्वरः
The Lord of the people. He has a great flood of over-flowing lordship which submerges all and shines brilliantly. So He is जनेश्वरः

## 344 अनुकूलः
He who is within bounds. By virtue of His greatness He is devoid of wonder, conceit and haughtiness and does not transgress the limits of lordship. अनुकूलः means He remains within bounds. Vide : "रामा has great valour, but He is not struck with wonder at such great valour." Or अनुकूल means He is slave towards His devotees. Vide : "The only support for the Prapanna is the hand of the Lord जनार्दन Who has been bought, as it were, by Bhakthi (devotion)." "O highly mischievous child! Make Thyself free, if Thoucanst."-(are the words of यशोद to कृष्ण ). And so on.

## 345 शतावर्तः
He of a hundred whirlpools. By the word 'आवर्ता ' (whirlpool) the over-flowing riches of the Lord are signified. The riches-though unlimited, are kept within bounds without over-flowing by His easy accessibility and appear like whirlpools of a stream when it flows through a narrow gorge and comes out. By this the Manthra of the Para-aspect of the Lord is corroborated which reads thus : "Unto Him of tranquil and ever-growing knowledge and life."

## 346 पद्मी
He who has lotus. He is invariably having a lotus with Him for sport . So He is called पद्मी.

## 347 पद्मनिभेक्षणः
He of lotus like glance. He has glances which dispel the afflictions of His devotees and which are like the pure and gently moving lotuses.

## 348 पद्मनाभः

So He is called Padma-garbha. Vide : "That lotus (namely the heart), which is subtle, flawless, and which is the seat of the Supreme Being." "The subtle lotus is His abode." "He who has taken His place on the lotus-seat." And so on.

## 351 शरीरभृत्
The Protector of His Body i.e Devotees With such an auspicious and enchanting body, भगवान् nourishes the meditator whom He considers and His own body. The nourishment and protection of such meditators is achieved only by means of His qualities which are being meditated upon by them with love and devotion. "When the eternal भगवान् abides in the heart of a person, the body of the latter becomes possessed of a great charm in this world." "O devout (disciple) I Your face shines like that of a person who has realised the Brahman." In fact a devotee is both like His Soul and like His body (in the eyes) of Bhagavँn. Vide : "Lord विष्णु protects His devotees like His own soul and body."

## 352 महर्द्धिः
He of immense riches. The same भगवान् is next described as being endowed riches. He has boundless riches which are sufficient to bring about the well-being and protection of His devotees.

## 353 ऋद्धः
The Prosperous. भगवान् thinks that He is prosperous (Ruddhah) only when His devotees are prosperous. Vide : "Having crowned (विभीषण ) as the King of Lanka. (रामा became free from fever and felt extremely happy, What a highly noble quality!)".

## 354 वृद्धात्मा
He of full-grown nature. He is वृद्धात्मा, because His essential nature is so great that it contains within itself even this supreme greatness of the qualities.

## 355 महाक्षः
He with a vehicle of powerful axle. (अक्ष literally means the axlea part of a chraiot. Here it is used to denote the chariot itself by a figure of speech known as Synecdoche (part put for the whole). So the word अक्ष in this name signifies a vehicle.) महाक्षः means भगवान् Who has a vehicle which is ' महान् ' worthy of reverence. भगवान् has for His vehicle Garuda who is said to be the very embodiment of the वेदा-s. Garuda serves as a vehicle for Bhagavँn Who is therefore called Garuda-वाहन .

## 356 गरुडध्वजः
garuda bannered. भगवान् is called Garuda-dhvaja since Garuda himself is the banner for भगवान् . That again is the unique symbol of भगवान् .

## 357 अतुलः
The Incomaprable Vide : "He has no equal".

## 358 शरभः
The destroyer. भगवान् destroys those who transgress the bounds (of ethics). "The affix 'abhach' comes after the roots 'kri', 'श्रि', 'sal', 'kal' and 'gard'." ('श्रि'+'abhach'=sarabha.)

## 359 भीमः
The Formidable. He is Bheema; therefore they are afraid of Him. He is भीम ; therefore they are afraid of Him. "The affix 'mak' comes after the root 'भी' (to fear) with the optional augment 'षुक्'. (Hence the words 'भीम', 'भीष' and 'भीष्म '.) "The words भीम ' and others are irregularly formed and govern a noun in the Ablative case." Out of fear from Him, वायु (the god of wind) and others do not transgress their bounds. Vide : "Out of fear from Him does the wind blow." "The entire world with everything in it which is existent in प्राण and which has proceeded there from, trembles on account of fear from Him, Who is like Vajra (the thunder-bold) up-lifted." "Only out of fear (from Him) the fire burns; the Sun blazes out of fear; out of fear Indra and वायु discharge their duties; Death, as the fifth, runs (i.e. performs its duties)." "(He Who is of the size of the thumb is the Brahman;) on account of trembling at Him (the whole world does its duty)."

## 360 समयज्ञः
The knower of the conventions. He is Samayajna, therefore He knows how the fire and other things should act; for example, the flame of the fire should go upwards. (Even after the period of deluge and at the beginning of creation) the Creator created the Sun and the Moon as before (and assigned their duties to them)." Or the name may be interpreted thus : He knows the proper time when He should offer Himself to the devotees; or when He should fulfil the vow of protection taken by Himself.

## 361 हविर्हरिः
He Who takes the offerings. "For the meditator there is delay only till he is not freed (from the body); then he attains (Me)." भगवान् knows the time laid down by the वेद thus and bestows Himself on them and is also taken by them. So He is 'Havih'. The word 'havi' is derived from the root 'hu' (to give and also to take). "The affix 'isi' comes after the verbs 'arch' 'such', 'hu', 'strip', 'chad' and 'chard'". ('hu'+'isi'=havih). The Name 'Hari' means that He removes the obstacles of the meditators. The word is derived from the verb 'harathi' (takes away) with the addition of the affix 'in'. This affix is added by the rule : "The affix 'in' comes after all roots." "Hari destroys all sins when He is remembered even by men with evil hearts. Even if fire is touched unawares, it certainly burns." Havir-Harih is one name. (The etymological meaning of the word 'Hari' is also given thus;) "I take my part of the oblations offered in sacrifices in houses; (hare=I take). The charming colour of my body is green. So I am known as Hari. (hari=green).

## 362 सर्वलक्षणः
लक्षण्यः He Who is appropriately distinguiढed by all symbols which define Him (as the Supreme Deity). भगवान् विष्णु as the Consort of लक्षमी is next dealt with. He is appropriately cognised by the knowledge which is characterised by the defining marks that proclaim His good fortune in having the constant embrace of the Goddess लक्षमी (and being Her consort). सर्वलक्षणः लक्षण्यःThose distinguishing marks are given in the following श्लोक : "One should meditate upon that Deity Who is the Consort of लक्षमी, Who has the splendour of the inner part of a lotus and Whose two hands are adorned by 'कमलालय' and हितेश ' (i.e. the lotus which is the abode of लक्षमी and चक्र which is the lord of all weapons)" And in His Manthra (He is portrayed as follows) : "O the Lotus eyed (Lord)! The Sea of Bliss and Good Fortune!" "The affix 'yath' is added after a noun in the Locative Case in the sense of 'excellent in regard thereto'."

## 363 लक्ष्मीवान्
He who ia always with lakshmi.He has the eternal comapnionship of lakshmi Therefore लक्ष्मीवान् He has the eternal companionship of लक्ष्मी. Vide : "At the time of my marriage (with Lakढmi). I in a playful mood placed (before all) the 'Dvaya'-(the great secret that The Supreme Reality is a Couple, and not नारायण alone, nor Lakढmi alone). Then I also revealed that like Myself लक्षमी also is beginningless (i.e. eternal). This Prakruthi was embraced by My hands, and I by Her hands; wherefore I have resorted to Her and she, in Her turn has resorted to me. (So we are always together.)" In this श्लोक , the word 'प्रकृति i' signifies लक्ष्मी, the Universal Mother.

## 364 समितिञ्जयः
Samitinjayah - The Victor in battles. भगवान् is the Father of the Universe since, लक्ष्मी is its Mother and so He always does things to bring about the joy of all. He wins over the जीवा-s and dispels the distress caused by the conflict in their minds about their being the servants of the Lord. This is revealed by His Manthra : "The Conquer of all distress." "The affix 'khach' comes after the following roots when the words to be formed denote a name, 'bhri', 'thri', 'vri' and 'ji'." (Ji + Khach = Jayah).

## 365 विक्षरः
He who never wanes. His love for the devotees, as described above never becomes less. So He is विक्षरः.

## 366 रोहितः
He Who is of red complexion. He is Rohita, because He has the red colour of the inside of a lotus.

## 367 मार्गः
He is sought after. He is Maarga, because He is always sought after by His worshipers. He is मार्ग , because He is always sought after by His worshippers. And this is His Manthra : "He Who bestows the frues desired."

## 368 हेतु
The Cause. He is the cause for realisation of their desires. He is the cause for the realisation of their desires. He is हेतु. हेतु is derived from the root 'hi' (to go). The affix 'thu' comes after the roots 'kam', 'man' 'hi' and others." (Hi+thu=हेतु).

## 369 दामोदरः
He who has the worlds in His belly. He is Daamodara, because the worlds are in His belly. He is दमोदर , because the worlds are in His belly. "Since, He has the strings in the form of worlds (दाम) within His bolly, He is known as दमोदर." "They know Him as दमोदर, because He has 'दाम' viz. Joy, indicating happiness for the gods." "He came to be known as दमोदर because of His being tied with a string (by यशोद)." Even though this skill of कृष्ण was admired and loved by लक्ष्मी also, still when He was bound by यशोद, He shed tears (and did not free Himself) out of His love for the devoted mother).

## 370 सहः
He who has patience. He is सहः, because He puts up with their binding Him with a string, threatening Him and chiding Him.

## 371 महीधरः
The Supporter of the Earth. He protects and supports the Earth by removing its burden.

## 372 महाभागः
The extreamely fortunate. He (कृष्ण) has the good fortune of being voluntarily chosen as Consort by the cowherdess नील , sixteen thousand celestial damsels, रुक्मणि, सत्यभाम,जांबवति and others. So He is महाभागः.

## 373 वेगवान्
He who is quick. Though He is in the stage of childhood exhibiting human qualities, still He is quick in manifesting His irresistible Supreme Sovereignty. He is वेगवान् . "The affix 'mathup' comes after a word in the sense of excelling in a quality."

## 374 अमिताशनः
The voracious Eater. He swallowed all the unlimited quantity of food hoarded by the cowherds for the worship of Indra. How (does He manifest His greatness. अमितासनः. He swallowed all the unlimited quantity of food hoarded by the cowherds for the worship of Indra. The cowherds who saw it were struck with wonder and began to entertain doubts (if He was an ordinary human being) and asked Him : "Who are you, a देव or an Asura (a god or a devil)?"

## 375 उद्भवः
The Remover of the bondage. Damodara (who was bound by a string round his stomach) cuts the bondage of others. "दामोदर (who was bound by a string around his stomach) cuts the bondage of others." As stated in this श्लोक . He removes the bondage of संसार of those who meditate upon Him as being bound by यशोदा . The bonds of the material world are cut by Him. So He is उद्भवः.

## 376 क्षोभणः
The Creator of a commotion. He creates tumult in the minds of those others who are fit to be bound and in the Prakruthi (the Primordial Matter) which binds them (at the time of creation).

## 377 देवः
He who diverts Himself. He is देवः , because He binds the जीवा-s with the strings of माया (Prakruthi) and plays with them even as the hunters do with the tigers and boars in the forest.

## 378 श्रीगर्भः
He who has Lakshmi always with Him लक्षमि is His companion whem He entertains by always associating with Her in this kind of sport (in this world). Vide : "This (लक्षमि) is ever inseparable from विष्णु.".

## 379 परमेश्वरः
The Supreme Ruler. His supreme rulership is made fruitful (by the protection of the world) as He got the voluntary embrace of लक्षमि. Vide : "राम shone very much with the beautiful सीत just as the mighty विष्णु , the Lord of the gods does with लक्षमि."

## 380 करणं
The Means. भगवान् is called करणम् because He is the greatest means for attaining Him. Ear, eye and other organs which are the means of knowledge, hands, feet and others which are the instruments of action are called 'करण' (i.e. means of instrument) because of their having a tiny particle of this power of भगवान् . Vide : "The eye and that which is seen is नारायण ; the ear and that which has to be heard is नारायण ". And also other texts like these.

## 381 कारणं
He who causes others to act. It is भगवान् Who makes all endowed with those organs of sense and action do their respective acts.

## 382 कर्ता
The agent. He is the independent agent in all those acts. A जीव or the individual soul, who has the right to do an act and reap its fruit, considers that the resulting pleasure or pain is his own. In the same manner or probably in a greater degree, भगवान् regards the pleasure of the pain of the जीवा as His own. "When the subjects (of His kingdom) are in distress, श्री राम feels much more distressed; and in all their joys in festivities, He feels rejoiced like a father (at the joy of his child)." If the distress and joy of भगवान् and of the जीव were distinct and different, and if the joy and the sorrow of the जीव were not considered as His own by परमात्मा, then the Upanishadic text that the Brahman itself has become many will not be appropriate. For the Upanishad says that the Supreme Brahman willed "I shall become many; (for that) I shall take birth."

## 383 विकर्ता
He Who is affected and undergoes modifications. Since, भगवान् identifies Himself with all beings, their joys, sorrows etc., which are the fruit of their acts good and bad, are experienced by Him also as though they were His own and He undergoes mutations. So He is called विकर्ता. He has no joy or sorrow which results from His own act; and the experience of joy and sorrow is only for the sake of others. So it does not bring any discredit to भगवान् . Otherwise, how can such noble qualities be predicated of Him, qualities like feeling sorrowful at the sorrows of others?

## 384 गहनः
He who is deep and inscrutable. He is गहनः (beyond the understanding of all) because of this magnificent quality of identifying Himself with the Individual souls and considering their knowledge, abode, enjoyment and instruments of enjoyment as His own and protecting them. "Though भगवान् remains with them, the gods do not understand Him." "He Who remains in the Earth (but whom the Earth does not know)." The entire section of the अन्तर्यामि ब्रह्मणे beginning with this Manthra is relevant to this idea. In the Subalopanishad : "नारायण is both the eye and the object to be seen." "The seat of action (i.e. the body) the agent, the different kinds of organs, the manifold and distinctively functioning vital airs (literally distinctive activities) and also Providence forming the fifth in this set these five are the causes in respect of every act.".

## 385 गुहः
The Saviour. In this way He protects all (gu:dhathi) and hence Guhah.

## 386 व्यवसायः
The pivot of the planets. The circle of planets is closely fastended in Him.

## 387 व्यवस्थानः
The Basis for the division of time.

## 388 संस्थानः
The final end.All things will have their ultimate end in Bhagavan, whose name therefore is Samsthaanah.

## 389 स्थानदः
The Giver of the Supreme abode. He alone is स्थानदः , (the Giver of the Abode) as the Manthra describes Him : "Unto Him, the cause for the attainment of Paramapada (the Transcendental Abode by the जीवा-s)."

## 390 ध्रुवः
The Stationary. He conferred a high place on ध्रुवः , who belonged to a later age and made him stationary. Hence He is Himself ध्रुवः. The truth about ध्रुवः is that He is all-pervasive.

## 391 परर्द्धिः
He of noble and auspicious qualities. The abundance of the auspicious qualities in भगवान् in His Incarnation as राम is superior even to the Supreme Overlordship of सर्वेश्वर . Hence He is Parardhih. It is because of this that, even though रामा-'s status is very high, He is often compared with सोम and other gods who are of a lower rank. Vide : "In valour रामा is similar to विष्णु ; He has a delightful appearance like the Moon." राम is endowed with transcendent nature. (This is revealed by the words of Dasarattha addressed to लक्षमण ) : "Dear son (लक्षमण) : It has been declared (by Brahma and other gods) that this राम is really the Supreme Brahmam incarnate. He cannot be realised by those who are bereft of devotion. He is immutable by nature. He is the inner Soul of all gods and a Mystery that can be known only by means of the उपनिषद्s. He is the conqueror of His enemies." "O King (Dasarattha) Many are the auspicious qualities, that are in your son, श्री राम." These are the words of the members of the Assembly summoned by Dasarattha for consulting them about Rama's coronation. "Unto भगवान् " is the phrase in the Manthra that pertains to Him, (i.e. श्री राम )

## 392 परमः
स्पष्टः He whose greatness is explicit. He is Param-spashtha. His greatness can be clearly cognised by means of direct perception. He is Parama-स्पष्ट. His greatness can be clearly cognised by means of direct perception. Vide : "It is evident that Sri Rँma is 'महा-योग'He is ever immersed in the one great thought of the protection of the world. He is the Supreme Soul and eternally existent (without any mutations.)" "श्री राम is the Sun even of the Sun."

## 393 तुष्टः
He who was pleased. He was much more pleased with the attainment of the state of being the son of Dasarattha and being the protector of the world when the entire humanity would have the right to approach Him for help than with the state of Supreme Lordship which can be resorted to only by those who have the necessary qualifications. Vide : "Then Bhagavँn chose Dasarattha as His father.". "राम highly valued the Dharma (duty) of a क्षत्रिय quite in consonance with the fact that He had taken birth in the race of क्षत्रिय. " "I consider myself a human being राम the son of Dasarattha"(these are the words of राम to the gods who appeared before Him).

## 394 पुष्टः
He who is replete. He is पुष्टः replete with noble qualities like these. Vide : "Him Who was possessed of such noble qualities."

## 395 शुभेक्षणः
The Auspicious eyed. He has charming lotus-like eyes which are cool, large, magnanimous and long which reveal His lordship and also His amiable nature. "He has beautiful eyebrows and long red eyes. He is indeed Bhagavँn विष्णु Himself." Or the word 'शुभेक्षण ' can be taken to signify : to be the object that is seen or to be the agent who sees; both were to His liking. Vide : "Whoever has not seen राम or whomsoever राम has not seen, that person stands condemned by all the people in the world, and even his own self condemns him."

## 396 रामः
He who delights. He is राम, "because all are always delighted by Him being charmed by His form and qualities". Vide : "राम is the foremost among those who delight (the minds of all people)." "राम , Who is fascinating by virtue of His qualities." "राम , the dark-hued and red-eyed youth, Who is majestic like the best of elephants." "Like the Sun that shines with its rays, राम shone brightly with His qualities which charmed the subjects of His kingdom and which were a source of joy to His father." This is revealed, also by the Manthra about Him. "Unto Him Who has the splendour of the autumnal blue lily and a lovely body."

## 397 विरामः
He before Whom all become powerless. He is विरामः, because before Him all become powerless-all, gods like Brahma who grant the boons, रावण and others who have acquired the boons (by their austerities) and the boons themselves of being indestructible even by death. Vide : "The four-faced and self-born Brahma (rudra, the three-eyed destroyer of the three cities of gold, iron and silver, and Indra the great chief of gods-no one can save that person whom राम has willed to slay)."

## 398 विरतः
The Unattached. भगवान् is विरतः, because of the spirit of detachment which is natural to Him. He has no love for kingship and other trifles. Vide "Even the loss of the kingdom did not deprive Him (राम) of His splendour just as the night cannot take away the loveliness of the cool-rayed moon." "The carrying out of the order of exile given by His father was much more to His liking than even the coronation. Then He really shone with splendour." "Even when श्री राम abandoned the kingdom under the plea of Dharma (viz. Obeying father's words), and when He led me to the forest where I had to move on foot, (there was neither disappointment nor grief, nor fear in राम "सीता says.) मार्गः He Who is sought after. He is sought after even by sages like भरद्वाज. विराजो मार्गः is another reading. 'विराजः' means dustless (i.e. faultless); 'मार्गः ' signifies 'path'. The meaning is : 'The path shown by श्री राम is faultless.' Vide : "The goal of those who are in the habit of conducting sacrifices as well as the goal of those who tend and worship the (five) fires, (you will attain that goal by my command)." (These are the words of श्री राम to जटायु .) "(The arrow discharged from the bow of श्री राम ) secured for वालि the Supreme Goal."

## 399 नेयः
He Who is governed by his devotees. He willingly heeds the commands of His friends; hence He is Neya. Vide :-- "I am agreeable to be commanded by those who practise austerities." "I wish to have an abode in this forest here in a place allotted by you". "Though wise and capable by himself, a person desirous of permanent good should, in times of difficulties, consult his good-hearted friends and agree to be guided by them." In the सभा पर्व (महाभारत), श्री कृष्ण Himself says : "O युधिष्ठिर ! When I am here for doing what is good to you, conduct the sacrifice (राज सूय यज्ञ) that you desire to do. You may ask me to do whatever you want. I shall certainly carry out your behests." Again in the उद्योग पर्व (महाभारत ) : "O long-armed scion of the royal dynasty of Bharatha! I am here ready to do whatever you want. I shall carry out your commands." (लक्षमण was struck by the weapon, Sakthi by name, and had fallen down unconscious.) All the inimical राक्षसा-s joined together and tried to lift and carry him away. They could not even move him. But he was light to Hanuman (the son of वायु) who lifted him single-handed because of the latters's love and devotion for him."

## 400 नयः
He who draws towards Himself all. He is Naya, because all the beings are drawn towards him by His benevolent nature.The sages themselves said to राम "We are to be protected by Thee always like children, even though we are sages with penance as our treasure." "(O कृष्ण !) Thou art the protector of the पाण्डवा-s; so we also resort to Thee for protection."

## 401 अनयः
He Who cannot be spirited away. भगवान् is Anaya since He cannot be led away by those who are not well-disposed towards Him. "रावण who could lift with ease even the mountains, the हिमालया-s, Mandara and Meru, as well as the three worlds with all the gods, could not lift up in the battle-field even with both his hands the younger brother of Bharatha (i.e. लक्षमण ). (The reference here is to the efforts of रावण to carry away लक्षमण when the latter had fallen down unconscious struck by the Sakthi weapon of रावण). Or 'Ayah' is the means which brings prosperity. 'Anayah' signifies that there is no one else except भगवान् who can bring prosperity to the people of the world. Vide "When He is there as our ruler and Protector, we have all our desires fulfilled."

## 402 वीरः
He who is the cause of terror. भगवान् is the source of fear and terror for the राक्षसा-s. So He is called वीरः . The word 'वीर ' is derived from the root 'Aja' (to drive or lead). 'वी' is the substitute for 'Aja' when an अर्ध-धातुक affix follows with the exception of the two affixes-'Ghajn' and 'Ap'. It also takes the affix 'Rak' under the rule "The affix 'Rak' comes after 'Sphayi', 'Tanch', 'Chadi', 'Aj' and other roots. "When रावण , the king of the राक्षसा-s, even thought of the arrows of श्री राम , which had the lustre of the club of Brahma and the glitter of the lightning he became uneasy." "The king (रावण ) was overpowered by the powerful राम like the elephant by the lion, and the serpent by Garuda." Thus did मारीच say : "In every tree do I see श्री राम dressed in the tree-dark and black deer-skin and with His bow drawn as though He is the god of death with the ropes in hand." And other such texts also.

## 403 शक्तिमतां
श्रेष्ठः The greatest among the powerful. He who is the most praiseworthy amongst the powerful gods and others.

## 404 धर्म
Virtue (incarnate). भगवान् is धर्म since, He sustains all beings by conferring prosperity and salvation on them. The affix 'man' has been added to the root 'Dhr' under the rule : "The affix 'man' comes after the roots 'arti', sthu, su, nu, sri, dhri, क्षि, क्षु, भा,या,वा, padi, यक्ष and ni." सोम and other words are formed by the same rule. Brahma, the best of those who know the Dharma, said the same to SrंRँma. "Thou art the Supreme Dharma in all the worlds." ('On an oath before discharging the arrow against Indrajit, लक्षमण said:) "If श्री रामा , the son of Dasarattha, is Dharma incarnate, is wedded to truthfulness and is unparalleled in valour, then, O arrow! Kill the son of रावण (i.e. Indrajit)." And many others also say so; "Those Brahmins, who are well-versed in the वेदा-s, and those people who have realised the Brahman, declare in one voice that the great श्री कृष्ण is the eternal Dharma incarnate." "The sacred द्वारवती is the place where (श्री कृष्ण ) the Slayer of Madhu resides." "He is the ancient God Himself and also the eternal Dharma incarnate." Others have said : "Dharma along with Arttha (i.e. wealth) proceed from श्री राम Himself."

## 405 धर्मवित्
उत्तमः The foremost among the Dharma-conscious. He is the best of those who have a knowledge of Dharma. Though श्री राम was their disciple, वसिष्ठ, वामदेव ,मार्कण्डेय and other sages resorted to Him for a knowledge of Dharma. Vide : "Like the ocean by the rivers, श्री राम was always resorted to by good men with respect." "He was highly respected by those who were well-versed in the वेदा-s". "He rightly knew the वेदा-s and their अन्गा-s (auxiliaries)." "Thou art unknowable and invincible. Thou hast conquered the senses and art the embodiment of the best Dharma. Thou art clear-sighted and endowed with undying reputation. Thou hast Earthlike forbearance and blood-red eyes." (These are the words of Thara, the Monkey-Queen).

## 406 वैकुण्ठः
Remover of obstacles of union. He brings about the union of all. The word वैकुण्ठः is derived from the root 'kuti' which means obstructing the path. Here it signifies the obstacles to the union. वैकुण्ठःs are those whose obstacles have been removed. भगवान् belongs to them and so He is called वैकुण्ठः. Vide "By me the Earth was united with water, ether with air and air with fire. So I am called वैकुण्ठः ." Such a quality was seen in भगवान् when He came as श्री राम . Vide "The subjects of रामा's kingdom observed this quality in रामा and remembering it they never caused mutual harm." When रामा was not with them, they never relished each other's company. This can be seen in the words of the wives to their husbands. "Either go after श्री रामा or get away so that nothing will be heard of you." "The elephants gave up eating their fodder and the cows would not allow the calves to come and drink the milk from their udder." "The people were not happy when they got back their lost wealth, nor were they pleased when new wealth came to them in large quantities. The mother felt no joy when she gave birth to a son for the first time." "Children yearning for mother's milk, the husbands of women and brothersevery one of them abandoned the other and then began to go after Srं राम."

## 407 पुरुषः
The Purifier. He is पुरुष , because He purifies all by nature and is devoid of all sins. Vide :-- "O the scion of the Raghus! Thou alone art the purifier of all the worlds." Sabari said to राम : "O gentle Sir that bestows honour! I have been purified by Thy charming eyes." The word 'पुरुष' is derived from the root 'pri' (to protect or nourish). Or the word 'पुरुष' is formed by the affix कुषन् ' to the base 'purah'. That राम alone is considered to be the 'पुरुष ' in every way. "These six गुणा (qualities) add to the lustre of श्री रामा; the पुरुषोत्तम." "श्री रामा is the सारंग-bow-wielder; He is हृषीकेश He is the पुरुष and also the पुरुषोत्तम ."

## 408 प्राणः
The vita air (life breath). He is the life breath of all. भगवान् is प्राणा since, He is the life-breath of all.

## 409 प्राणदः
The life giver. भगवान् is प्राणद since He bestows the well-known life itself to all. It is because of this that in His separation. "Even the trees with their flowers, buds and sprouts withered." "All that remained in the forests and gardens were only dry leaves."

## 410 प्रणवः
He Who makes others bow before Him. By virtue of His qualities He makes the sentient and the non-sentient bow before Him. So He is प्रणवः . The वेदिc etymology reads 'He makes others bow.' "As श्री राम was possessed of charming qualities. He moved the hearts of the people (when he set off for the forest)."

## 411 पृथुः
Well known. Bhagavan is great by His extensive reputation. भगवान् is great (Prutthu) by His extensive reputation. The word 'Prutthu' is derived from the root 'Prattha' (to be renowned). "The affix 'ku' is added to the roots 'pratthi', 'mradi', and 'bhrasj' , and there is the vocalisation of 'ra' into 'ri' and the elision of 's' in 'bhrasj'.". "The son of the King Dasarattha is endowed with world-wide renown." "He was well-known as राम to all people." "Amongst them श्री राम was the most reputed." "He was the unique seat of all fame." And so on.

## 412 हिरण्यगर्भः
He who was in the delightful hearts. By being the object of meditation even to those who were not contemporaneous with the period of His incarnation, He was of great help to them. So He is called हिरण्यगर्भः . It also signifies that as the auspicious object of their meditation. He remains concealed in the loving and delightful hearts of those who contemplate on Him. Or it may be taken to signify that He is like a treasure of gold. Vide the Manthra on His meditation : "He alone is to be meditated upon as the Soul of the Universe."

## 413 शत्रुघ्नः
The Enemy -slayer. He is called Satrughna, because Bhagavan subdues by his arrows of wisdom the groups of sense which are enemies like Ravana and which lead away people to the enjoyment of the earthly pleasures. He is called Satrughna, because भगवान् subdues by His arrows of wisdom the groups of senses which are enemies like रावण and which lead away people to the enjoyment of the earthly pleasures. About meditation on Him it is stated : "He subdues the mind and the ten sense-organs of the योगिs with the power of discrimination even as श्री राम vanquished the frightful ten-headed रावणा , the राक्षस chief with hosts of arrows. (Note : The mind is compared to रावण and the ten Indriyas to his ten heads and the arrows that राम used to kill him to discrimination.) "And the affix 'tak' comes after the verb 'han' (to kill) when the object is in composition with it and when the word to be formed denotes an agent other than a human being". (But the word 'Satrughna' is valid under the 'मूल विभुजादि ' class and is formed by affix 'ka'.) "The root-vowel of 'gam', 'han' etc. is elided before an affix beginning with a vowel when it has an idnicatory 'k' or 'gn'. "A guttural is substituted for the 'h' in 'han' before an affix having an indicatory 'jn' or 'n' and before 'n'.

## 414 व्याप्तः
He Who is full (of love and affection). His affection towards innocent children and aged persons, master and servant, friends and foestowards all, 'it is uniform and there is no difference. So He is 'व्याप्तः '. Vide : 'राम makes full and kind enquiries of all His subjects as though they are His kinsfold in their respective order regarding their sons, sacrificial fires, wives, servants and disciples even as a father would of his own sons." "Even towards His enemies राम is kind." And so on.

## 415 वायुः
He who moves towards his devotees. He is called 'वायु ', because He Himself goes seeking His devotees wherever they may be. Vide : "श्री राम of great valour and the destroyer of enemies, Himself went to the abode of Sabari (the hunter-woman) with respect seeking her." "राम went to the hermitage of भरद्वाज ." "राम of virtuous nature approached Guha, (the chieftain of the hunters)." "The affix 'un' comes after the roots 'kri', 'वा', 'पा', 'जा' and 'mi'." (वा +u=वायु ).

## 416 अधोक्षजः
He who does not get diminished. भगवान् is like a sea of nectar and even though He is enjoyed by all and at all times, He is अधोक्षजः (i.e. never gets diminished). "Since, He never gets lessened, He is called अधोक्षजः." "I know Thee as being imperishable Who art the slayer of Madhu (Asura) and the Lord of all gods." "Thy fame never gets lessened." And so on.

## 417 ऋतुः
He who moves towards. He gets into the hearts of all by virtue of the successive waves of His qualities which are unique and highly delightful. He gets into (the hearts of) all ऋतुः . It is because of such a quality the seasons like Vasantha and Sisira get the name of 'ruthu'. (Vasantha=Spring; Sisira = Cool season.) Vide :=-- The word 'rithu' is derived from the root 'ru' (to go) by the rule "The affix 'thu' comes after the root 'ri'."

## 418 सुदर्शनः
- He of a delightful appearance. The very sight of Him is a source of delight and auspiciousness even to those who may be ignorant of His qualities and greatness. Vide : "Like the Moon, राम had a delightful form." "Ever delightful was the sight of राम ."

He who draws all towards himself. He isकाल , because He gathers all towards Himself all the things, moving and non-moving, by such delightful qualities.

## 420 परमेष्ठी
He who is in the Supreme abode. After sporting thus in this world by hunting the राक्षसा-s and protecting the people, He goes and stays in the Supreme Abode. So He is परमेष्ठी . Vide : The affix 'ini' comes after the root 'स्था' (to stand) preceded by the word 'parame'. The 's' of 'sttha' is changed to 'ष' after 'amba', 'आम्ब' etc. The Locative ending is not elided after a stem ending in a consonant or a short 'a', when the compound is a name. "He entered the resplendent world of विष्णु with His own body and His followers." The same is stated in the सभा पर्व also. Vide : "Thus the long-armed राम , the scion of the इक्ष्वाकु race would slay रावण with all his hosts and ascend to the Heaven."

## 421 परिग्रहः
He who takes all with Him. Here, there and everywhere, He accepts allParigrahah. He brought about the attainment of the Transcendent World (Parama-pada) not only to the citizens (of अयोध्य ) and the subjects (of His kingdom) who had direct contact with Him and those related to them, but also the gods they worshipped and their gardens along with their trees, grass etc. "Whoever had love and devotion for His Incarnations." The predominant characteristic in श्री रामावतार is amiability.

## 422 उग्रः
The Formidable. At the end of the (Kali) yuga when all are more inclined to commit sins and there is great confusion in the divisions of caste and the several stages of life (वर्णा and आश्रम). भगवान् becomes Ugrafurious and wrathful. His Manthra portrays Him thus : "Unto Him who is the very embodiment of destruction and is like the death-giving वैश्वानर Fire." श्री पौष्कर (Samhitha) says : "भगवान् विष्णु incarnates Himself as Kalki when there is complete destruction of Dharma (virtue) and after destroying the hosts of Mlecchas remains in this world". The word 'ugra' is derived from the root 'uch' (to collect). 'Rijra', 'indra', 'agra', 'ugra' and other words are formed irregularly (by the addition of the affix 'ran').

## 423 संवत्सरः
He who resides. He is called 'Samvathsarah' as He resides in the पाताळलोक reclining on Anantha (the आदिशेष ) fully armed with all the weapons ready for action awaiting the time (for manifestation). The injunction for meditation on Him is as follows : "Him Who has mounted the Anantha-couch." "He Who is surrounded by Discus and other weapons, all in embdded forms." The word 'Samvathsara' is derived from the root 'vasathi' preceded by the preposition 'sam'. "The affix 'sara' comes after the root 'vas' (to dwell) when it is preceded by an उपपद and the affix is treated as 'cit' which places the accent on the last syllable.

## 424 दक्षः
He who is quick in action. "Kalki will be ever roaming about the world engaged in the destruction of the Dasyus (miscreants). He will annihilate the Dasyus who are crying hoarse intensety." As stated above भगवान् is quick in the act of exterminating the Dasyus. So He is दक्ष . "Very quickly does जनार्दन act" says another text. "The word 'dakढa' is derived from the root ' दक्ष ' (to grow or act quickly).

## 425 विश्रामः
The place of rest. भगवान् is the place of rest for those beings who are extremely tired by the heavy burden of their sins and by the experience of their fruits. In सभा पर्वम् ( महाभारत ) it is said : "भगवान् comes into this world for the growth of Dharma and for the protection of the Brahmins (who are pious)."

## 426 विश्वदक्षिणः
He Who is well-disposed towards all. How can it be said that He is benevolent to those who are evil-doers? The answer is विश्वदक्षिणः. He shows His favour uniformly towards all, whether their actions are right or wrong. Benevolence is that quality which shढows forbearance even towards the wrong-doers. Vide : "He will shower His favour on the entire world." Or in the अश्व मेध Sacrifice (conducted by श्री राम) 'Visvam'the entire Earth was 'दक्षिण'the gift to the Brahmins given by Him. So He is विश्वदक्षिणः . Vide in the अरण्य पर्व (महाभारत) : "Then He will destroy all the robbers and will offer this Earth itself as दक्षिण in the great अश्वमेध Sacrifice to the Brahmins (officiating as priests in the sacrifice). "The affix 'inan' is added to the roots 'dru' and 'दक्षि'" dru (द्राविण); दक्षि (दक्षिण).

## 427 विस्तारः
He who spreads. He is विस्तारः . From Him Who destroys the Kali Yuga by great force and establishes the Krutha Yuga, the moral laws of the वेदास् spread out. Vide : "O भारत ! Then with the advent of the Kritha Yuga, there will be the end of Adharma (unrighteousness) and the rise of Dharma (righteousness). People will begin to do meritorious acts." "The affix 'ghajn' comes after the root 'sthr' (to cover) when the preposition " 'vi' is in composition with it, when the sense is that of extension and when such spreading does not refer to words. (Vi+sthr=विस्तारः ).

## 428 स्थावरस्थाणुः
He who is tranquil after the establishment of the dharma. When the Dharma has been firmly established, He would be tranquil. In the अरण्य पर्व : "After establishing the auspicious moral law of the Universe as laid down by the four-faced God (Brahma)"

Vide : "The man of wisdom takes refuge in Me with this thought that वासुदेव is everything." "The affix 'than' comes after the roots 'उष', 'कुष', 'gai' and 'ri'. (Ri (to go) + tha = arttha).

## 432 अनर्थः
He who is not the goal. He is not sought after disinterestedly (Anarttha) by a person who has only a little merit and who is after the acquisition of wealth. If that person comes to Him, it is only with a desire for acquiring wealth. Vide : "कुबेर (एक-पिङ्ग ) seeks me for wealth." "There are three other kinds of devotees of Mine and they are known to be desirous of other fruits. (The three kinds of devotees are : they who want to regain their lost wealth, they who are eager to acquire new wealth and they who long for the Realisation of the Self (Kaivalya)." एक पिङ्गतीs is an epithet of कुबेर (having a yellow mark in the place of one of this eyes).

## 433 महाकोशः
He who has a great Treasure. भगवान् has vast treasures (महा कोश ) in His possession which never become less even though they may be given as gifts to all at all times and in all ways-treasures like Sankha, Padma etc. and the रोहण mountain. The inexhaustible nine Nidhis or treasures are : 1. Sankha, 2. Padma, 3. महा -padma, 4. Makara, 5. Kacchapa, 6. Mukunda, 7. Kunda, 8. नीला and 9. Kharva or Vara.

## 434 महाभोगः

Similarly wealth has been obtained from Him by others. Likewise, by yet others काम (the sensual enjoyment)

## 436 अनिर्विण्णः
He who is never despondent. Thus भगवान् creates this world and grants the respective desires of the people (thinking that they would resort to Him for their redemption). But the worldly-minded are infatuated by the pleasures of the world and are not inclined to turn to Him. Thus His expectations are not successful. In spite of this भगवान् does not become dispirited or despondent and again with the fond hope that He will succeed in His next effort, (i.e. diligence) continues His acts. So He is अनिर्विण्णः. It is because of this that there is neither beginning nor end for the creation of the world by भगावन् . "These acts of creation, protection, destruction and control by भगावन् go on uninterruptedly."

## 437 स्थविष्ठः
He who is of an extremely prodigious size. The famous cluster of Stars known as शिंशुमार-चक्र in Heavens described in the उत्तम-अनुवाक of स्वाध्याय -ब्राह्मण and विष्णु पुराण is an example for the absence of despondency and for the ceaseless effort for redeeming the world seen in भगवान् . He is स्थविष्ठः because of His prodigious size in the form of a cluster of stars. Vide : "The all-powerful भगवान् has a body in the form of Simsumँra consisting of a group of Stars."

## 442 नक्षत्री
He Who has the stars. "There is a cluster of luminaries in the sky in the form of शिशुमार (porpoise). नारायण makes them move. With His place in the heart of those luminaries, He is their support." Thus भगवान् is the support of all these luminaries and so He is called नक्षत्री

He Who is competent. Thus, भगवान् bears with ease the burden of the entire UniverseKढamah. "He is known as प्रवाह since, He bears all the luminaries."

## 444 क्षामः

"A group of four stars of the शिशुमार does not set." "O मैत्रेय ! At the time of the dissolution of the Earth inclusive of the five elements, all the luminaries up to the region of Dhruva disappear and Dhruva alone remains shining in his place." The word ' क्षामः' is derived from the root 'क्षज' (to waste away). "Ma' is substituted for the 'निष्ठ' (past passive Participle) 'tta' after the root 'क्षयि'.

## 445 समीहनः
He who makes others work in their respective posts. After the deluge at the time of creation He always makes all do their work in their respective posts. "All the beings go round Thee again and again." In उद्योग पर्व (महाभारत ) : "जनार्दन , the Supreme पुरुष , sets in motion, as if in sport, the Earth, the Heavens, the Interim Space as well as all the beings.

## 446 यज्ञः
The Sacrifice. भगवान् has been delineated in the विष्णु पुराण as the sacrifice, its means and the ultimate goal (its fruit). The section there begins thus : "In that place where Dhruva has been stationed in the firmament, that placewhich is known as the विष्णु पाद in the third region, which is celestial and resplendent." Then it proceeds to describe in order the several regions of Dhruva, the luminaries, clouds and rains. This Earth is the fruit of 'ijya' (sacrifice) and 'ijya' has this world as its foundation." "Then the fires are nourished through the offerings of ghee in sacrifices." Therefore भगवान् Himself is called Yajna. Vide : "Sacrifice itself is विष्णु ." "After the verbs 'yaj' (to worढip), 'यच्' (to ask for), 'yath' (to strive), 'vich' (to shine), 'pracch' (to ask) and 'raksh' (to preserve) comes the affix 'nagn' with the force of denoting mere action etc."

## 447 इज्यः
He who is the object of worship. He alone is the worthy object of worढip that is done indirectly through Indra and other gods by people whose aim is to acquire 'काम ' or fruits of a lower order. "Those who worship the Pithru (the spirits of their forefathers), the gods, the Brahmins as well as Agni (Fire)they (in reality) worship only विष्णु Who is the Inner Soul of all beings." "Those, however, who are devotees of other gods and with great faith worship them, (they too worship only Me, but not in the manner and according to the rules prescribed there-to)." (श्री कृष्ण in the गीत). "(भगवान् Who is the Supreme Person is adored) by the man who performs the duties and rites of his वर्ण and आश्रम. Nothing else delights भगवान् so much)" And so on.

## 448 महेज्यः
He who is the object of superior worship. He is महेज्यः (the object of supreme worship) which is not sullied by desire for other fruits.

The Krathus are the seven सोम-संस्था comprising Agni-होत्र and the like. भगवान् is worshipped by all these Krathus. The word 'Krathu' which means 'that which is conducted' is derived from the root 'kru' (to do). "The affix 'krathu' comes after the verb 'kru' (to do)" Note : The Pancha महा-यज्ञा-s are : 1.

## 450 सत्रं
He who is the sacrifice. Saththra is a sacrificial session, especially one lasting from 13 to 100 days conducted by many यजमाना (masters). भगवान् is called Saththra, because He is there always in the Saththra as the object of worship. The word 'saththra' is derived from the root 'sad' (सीदाती) signifying movement. "The affix 'thra' comes after the following roots : 'gu' 'dhru' vee', 'pach' 'vach', 'yam', 'sad' and 'kshad'.

## 451 सतां

Next it is stated that He is also the goal for those who are wedded to Nivruththi-dharma (i.e. discontinuance of wordly acts or emotions. (quietism). विष्णु पुराण itself says : "O Brahmin! That is a sublime place for यती-s (i.e. योगिns) who have washed off the mire of sins and who have controlled their minds when all their merits and sins have been annihilated."

## 452 सर्वदर्शी
The all seer. It is His nature to preside over and witness the practice of the two kinds of Dharma (namely Pravruththi-dharma and Nivruththi-dharma).

## 453 निवृत्तात्मा
He whose mind is turned away from worldly desires The forms of भगवान् as नर ,नारायण etc. are for instructing the world in the Nivruththi-dharma, one of the two धर्मा-s.

उत्तमम् The greatest knowledge. The great वैष्णव Dharma in all its entirety can be learnt from Him. "Him Who propounds all the Sasthrँs including the पञ्च रात्र ."

## 456 सुव्रतः
He of good vows. "O Arjuna! (Son of पार्थ )! There is nothing that I have to do for self-advancement." On this principle all the acts of भगवान् are for the good of others and therefore all His observances are always auspiciousSuvratha. "A person should meditate upon Him as standing on one leg, living on air and teaching the fornightly and monthly fasts (by observing them.)

## 457 सुमुखः
He with a charming face. He has a face which is unchanging pleasing and delightful even while reciting the Manthra and other things. So He is Sumukha. "He is chanting the Manthra 'ॐ-कार' by name which has been realised by Him within Himself." The Manthra about Him says : "To श्री कृष्ण, Who has a face with eyes pure and spotless like the lotus-petal."

## 458 सूक्ष्मः
The subtle. He is सूक्ष्मः because of His essential nature which is extremely subtle and can be realised by deep and unsullied meditation. "All were engaged in the meditation on Brahman." "The suffix 'sman' comes after the root 'su:ch' (to pierce). (सूच+स्म=सूक्ष्मः).

## 459 सुघोषः
He Who has the delightful voice of the Vedas in praise of Him. He is proclaimed by the वेदिc voice of the Upanishads.

The bliss -giver. He bestows the fruit in the form of Supreme Bliss (Sukhada) on those who practise good conduct and deep meditation by Himself observing them.

## 461 सुहृत्
The good -hearted. Wherefore this diligence to help others? Because He is Suhruth-a kind-hearted friend. Friendliness is that quality of a benevolent person who wished the good even for those who have not helped him in any way, and who being apprehensive of any evil that may befall them, always thinks 'How shall I help them?'.

## 462 मनोहरः
He who captivates the heart. He captivates their heart by His innate benevolence. He captivates their heart by His innate benevolence. "The affix 'ach' comes after the root 'hru' when it does not mean to raise up and when the object is in composition with it."

## 463 जितक्रोधः
He who has overcome anger. Anger and other such bad qualities have been conquered by Bhagavan. So He is जितक्रोधः. On seeing His form the minds of the Asuras became confounded with confusion and thereby He overcame the anger of the Asuras against the gods. On seeing His form the minds of the असुरा-s became confounded with confusion and thereby He overcame the anger of the असुरा-s against the gods.

## 464 वीरबाहुः
He of mighty arms. He has a thousand arms which vie with one another in the wonderful act of churningarms which are shining with effulgent bracelets, armlets and garlands.

## 465 विदारणः
He who cuts. With his celestial weapons He cut off Rahu and others. With His celestial weapons He cut off राहु and others. The Manthra about Him is : "He Who completely cuts off the formidable fear."

## 466 स्वापनः
He Who lulls them to sleep. With His elegant and lovely smiles, sweet glances and the play of His eyebrows, भगवान् fascinates and brings under His control those that stay behind when others have gone. He is स्वप्न . "He with eyes full of exuberant love and blooming youth".

## 467 स्ववशः
He who is under His own control. When others are asleep, He plays as he likes with those who are his own (i.e. gods).

## 468 व्यापी
The Pervader. In order to rejuvenate the gods, the Asuras, the Mandara mountain, Vasuki and others at the time of churning He pervades them with His own power. So He is Vyaapee. In order to rejuvenate the gods the असुरा-s, the Mandara mountain, Vँsuki and others at the time of churning He pervades them with His own power. So He is व्यापी".

## 469 नैकात्मा
He with diverse forms. He is नैकात्मा , because He had assumed many forms at the time of churning, one as विष्णु (to help the gods to churn), another as the Tortoise (to support the Mandara Mountain) and yet another as मोहिनि (to distribute the nectar).

## 470 नैककर्मकृत्
He of diverse acts. He did many acts like churning the ocean, supporting the mountain, overcoming the enemies, distributing the nectar and others. Thus He is Naika-karma-kruth.

## 471 वत्सरः
He who lives within all beings. Next भगवान् is described as धर्मात्मते embodiment of Dharma. For bestowing fruits in a just way for the acts of all, He resides in all beings. "The affix 'chara' comes after the root 'vas' (to dwell). (vas+chara=vathsara).The words in His Manthra are : "Unto Him Who is the embodiment of Dharma and Who lives in all beings."

## 472 वत्सलः
The Affectionate. The cause for that quality is described by the name Vathsala. He is affectionate towards His children who are attached to Him. He has great love and affection for those who have sought refuge in Him. Even though they have been with Him for a long time, He is eager to do something for their good for some inexplicable reason. This can be compared to the young mother cows' love for their new-born calves which (cows), not knowing what to do simply bellow and suffer from the burden of the udder full of milk which is trickling down. That भगवान् has such a quality is well-known from the attitude of श्री राम towards रावण . This is known from the words of सीता : "It is well-known that राम knows this great virtue, and that He is very affectionate towards those who who have sought refuge in Him". Since, भगवान् has taken this quality as an instrument in the protection of His devotees, that quality too has attained a reputation and popularity. "The affix 'lach' comes after the words 'vathsa' and 'amsa' in the sense of love and strength respectively."

## 473 वत्सी
He who is possessed of such loving children. There are innumerable hosts of souls who are to be ever tended by Him. "The affixes 'ini' and 'than' come in the sense of 'mathup' (being in possession of) after nominal stems ending in short 'a'; and in the alternative 'mathup' also comes. Here the affix 'ini' has come in the sense of constant connection with objects which are in great numbers.

## 474 रत्नगर्भः
He who is in possession of abundant wealth. Amongst His devotees there are some who are after wealth, and भगवान् has immense wealth to be given to them. "Under the guise of the Conch and the Discus, He bears अर्था and काम (wealth and desire)".

## 475 धनेश्वरः
The quick giver of wealth. He is quick in bestowing on His devotees whatever wealth they desire. "The affix 'varath' comes after the root 'as' (to pervade) when the word formed from it refers to 'having the power of granting success soon'. By the letter 'cha' the penultimate letter 'a' in 'as' is replaced by 'ं'.

## 476 धर्मगुप्
The Protector of Dharma virtue. He confers अर्थ and काम ; but He sees they are not misused and He protects Dharma through them. "He confers अर्थ and काम on those who wisely follow the path of Dharma (Virtue) with discretion."

## 477 धर्मकृत्
He who practices Dharma (virtue). Thus He makes all become addicted to Dharma and without any ulterior motive practises Dharma which is for their good. "Ordinary flawless Dharma, which is without beginning or end all pervasive, cannot be attained without His Grace even by those who have great knowledge."

## 478 धर्मी
He wh has Dharma as an instrument. He is धर्मी , because He has the well-known Dharma as a common means for all His acts.

## 479 सत्
He who is comendable. भगवान् is Sath, because the Dharma mentioned above is itself commendable."Likewise the word 'Sath', O Arjuna! Is employed with reference to a commendable action." The commendable nature of Dharma is due to the fact that Bhagavँn Who is to be attained by it is Himself highly commendable. His praise- worthiness is due to His eternal existence and auspiciousness which are unconditioned. The word 'Sath' is used in the sense of 'existence' and 'auspiciousness".

## 480 सदक्षरम्
He Who is ever existent without decrease or destruction. He is सदक्षर because His existence and goodness are eternal and unconditioned. Here the word 'अक्षर' is an adjective that qualifies the noun 'Sat'. 'क्षरम्' is that which comes to an end in some place or at some time. The true nature of भगवान् as सद्-अक्षर is described as follows : He is free from decrease, destruction, modification, growth and birth. He can only be spoken of as that which always is." The same is declared by the श्रुति also : "Existence alone, my dear child, this was in the beginning, one only without a second."

## 481 असत्
क्षरम् The giver of the worldly misery. In regard to those who are not commendable and are addicted to sins. भगवान् gives them the great misery of endless संसार (Birth and death). These two are spoken of in the Sruthi also : "भगवान् Himself makes that person do virtuous acts whom He wants to raise from these worlds. And He makes that another do sinful acts whom He wants to hurl into the lower worlds." "This world comprises the good and the bad. Bhagavँn is above both of them-the Asath and the sath."

## 482 असत्
क्षरम् The giver of the worldly misery. In regard to those who are not commendable and are addicted to sins. भगवान् gives them the great misery of endless संसार (Birth and death). These two are spoken of in the Sruthi also : "भगवान् Himself makes that person do virtuous acts whom He wants to raise from these worlds. And He makes that another do sinful acts whom He wants to hurl into the lower worlds." "This world comprises the good and the bad. Bhagavँn is above both of them-the Asath and the sath."

## 483 अविज्ञाता
The Non-cognizant. Even though He sees the innumerable sins committed by the pious devotees, He not only does not punish them, but also forgives them. Not only this much. He is even oblivious of their sins. So is it stated about श्री राम : "Though harsh words are used against Him, राम does not retaliate." Not taking into account the faults committed by those who have taken refuge in भगवान् is certainly a quality that is commendable. Therefore my revered father (श्री Vatsanka Misra, Koratthalvan) has said : "Thus we speak in reproof of Thy omni-science and say Thou art ignorant. Thou dost dote on the faults of Thy devotees." There are some who hold the view with reference to the Brahman, which is all-knowing, that it is pure consciousness and so not possessed of knowledge. They are really deaf to the words of the वेदा-s, the conclusions of the आचार्या-s and even to logical propriety. Those poor people are only to be pitied and are not worthy of refutation or criticism.

## 484 सहस्रांशुः
He who has thousand rays of knowledge. On the other hand He is omni-scient. Sahasra-amsuh'Sahasram' means countless and 'Amsu' means varieties of knowledge; So भगवान् has infinite knowledge. An objection may be raised : Is it not a contradiction to say that He is all-knowing and that He does not know the faults of His devotees? 'No' we say. Ignorance of the faults of His devotees means only that He ignores tham as being insignificant. He pays no attention to their faults. Vide : "Even a man of wicked deeds is a good man provided he worships Me without expecting any other benefit. (He is must be honoured; because his knowledge is sound.)"

## 485 विधाता
The controller. It cannot be said that even though It cannot be said that even though भगवान् forgives the sinning devotee, the latter will have to experience the punishment and tortures meted out to him by Yama whose duty is to punish the sinners. For Yama also is under the control of भगवान् (and he cannot do anything against His will. The name विधाता (the Supreme Controller) signifies this. Yama himself says (in विष्णु पुराण) : "The Supreme Lord Who is worshipped by Indra and other gods knows that I am impartial and so He has ordained me to do good or bad to people in the world according to their deserts."

## 486 कृतलक्षणः
He Who has prescribed the distinguishing characteristics (for the pious).If भगवान् Himself overlooks the faults of men, what is there that will distinguish the good from the bad by which He will accept the former and discard the latter? The reply is कृता-लक्षणः . He has laid down the distinguiढing characteristics of those who are to be favoured, viz. They are well disposed towards Him. ("Never shall I desert) him who has come to Me as a friend." "For he is rightly resolved". (when he seeks me with great devotion). Vide in Hari-vamsa : "They who bear the mark of the discus on their bodies may be admitted to my vicinity and they that do not have the mark ढould not be admitted near me." "In विष्णु-dharma : "While you are going about in the world, you will see that man alone violates my commands who does not bear mark of having sought refuge in विष्णु." In विष्णु तत्व : "The bearing of the mark of the discus and others on the body is indicative of his connection with Me even as the bracelet and other ornaments indicates the chastity of a woman (whose husband is alive)". This (bearing the mark of the discus) also may be the distinguiढing mark of a devotee of विष्णु . Anything other than this will lead only to his abandonment and therefore there is no room for the charge of partiality or cruelty in भगवान् .

## 487 गभस्तिनेमिः
He with an effulgwnt Discus. Those who bear these marks are unassailable to Yama and his servants. For their saviour is भगवान् Who is armed with the effulgent Chakra having a thousand spokes. "You should not even go near that place which is within the range of the glances of that devotee in whose heart the Supreme and imperishable Lord नारायण resides. In fact I too cannot go there because my valour and strength cannot stand before the Discus. Thet devotee belongs to an entirely different world." (This is the instruction of Yama to his servants.)

## 488 सत्त्वस्थः
He is in their hearts. Again they are impregnable to Yama and his followers since there is no Karma in them which alone is the cause of their sway over them, How is it they alone are devold of Karma? The answer is because भगवान् resides in their hearts(Saththvastthah). "When Lord Hari, Who is imperishable and eternal and Who wields the Discus and the Mace, abides in the heart of a person, how can sin exist there? Because the sin has been destroyed by Him. How can darkness co-exist with the Sun?" "When विष्णु Who is flawless like a spotless crystal gem is in the heart of a person, how can the defects like jealousy remain there?" So says the विष्णु-धर्म : "When a man's mind has resorted to कृष्ण at all times, the servants of Yama, his staff or ropes and the tortures cannot come near him." प्रह्लाद says in the वामन-पुराण : "Truly yet another thing has been declared by इक्ष्वाकु who is the foremost among men and who is endowed with Bhakthi viz. That those people in the world who are devotees of विष्णु are not under the control of Yama; not are they the denizens of his world." "The affix 'ka' comes after the root 'sthaa' when it is in composition with a word ending in a case-affix as an उपपद. (Hrudi+stthah=Hrudi-stthah). (Saththva+stthah=Saththva-stthah).

## 489 सिंहः
He who punishes. Not realising the greatness of devotees, if Yama and others assail them thinking that they are ordinary human beings, भगवान् punishes those assailants. So He is called 'Simhah'. Yama himself declares : "विष्णु has the power to control me also." Therefore मार्कण्डेय says in Lainga (पुराण ) : "When the gods see a वैष्णव who is exclusively devoted to वासुदेव (विष्णु ) and whose sins have been completely burnt out, they are afraid (of doing any harm to him) : They bow before him with respect and go away as they came. Yama also, who is the son of the Sun-god, on seeing a devout श्री वैष्णव bereft of all sins, would rise with respect and bow before him with folded hands. Therefore a person should worship with devotion the श्री वैष्णव-s as विष्णु Himself. The वैष्णव attain union with विष्णु. No doubt should be entertained about this." Again in the same (Lainga पुराण ) in the episode of Kausika the action of Brahma is described when he comes across some devotees of विष्णु who are singing His glories : "Brahma the पितामह (that is the grandfather the first creator) of the world, on seeking Kausika and other god-singers advanced towards them with respect, welcomed and worshipped them." In that story which begins thus much can be found relevant to this topic to the heart's content. In विष्णु -thaththva beginning to speak of hell it is said : "The servants of Yama automatically keep themselves away from those who have taken refuge at the feet of भगवान् Hari, and for whom Hari is the only master and no one else. Even the gods who are in charge of the Hell are afraid to do any harm to the वैष्णवा-s, because any insult to them will bring about the destruction of the entire world. Ever since the beginning of the world no devotee of विष्णु has ever been in the Hell. This is due to the great power of the valour of the Supreme being, भगवान्." Again in विष्णु Dharma : "Yama, the Lord of Hell, saw a being that was experiencing great suffering there and asked him, 'Have you not worshipped Lord केशव Who is the remover of all sorrows?'" And so on.

## 490 भूतमहेश्वरः
The supreme lord of all beings. Since भगवान् is capable of accomplishing all this He is भुत-महेश्वर . It is He that controls Brahma, Yama and others who are themselves lords of beings.

## 491 आदिदेवः
He Who is the first cause and is endowed with effulgence. भगवान् is the cause of all those gods also and is possessed of great splendour which subjugates them. So He is आदिदेवः . He is Adi-the cause and deva-ever-shining. "The wind blows out of fear from Him."

## 492 महादेवः
The great player. He is महादेव since He plays with those gods as playthings like dolls etc.

## 493 देवेशः
The ruler of gods. He is also the master of those gods.

## 494 देवभृत्
The Supporter of the gods. भगवान् is capable of assigning duties to the various gods according to their ability and thus protects them.

## 495 गुरुः
The preceptor. He is Guru, because He gives instruction to the gods in their respective spheres of duty through the वेदा-s. "He Who teaches him (i.e. Brahma) the वेदा-s." "I am under the control of my Guru भगवान् Hari"(says Brahma.) "Fire is 'guru' (the cause) of gold in purifying it from dirt (just like this भगवान् is guru of all since He enlightens them by dispelling their ignorance through the वेदा-s )." "He is the teacher of even the ancients, for He is eternal and not limited by time." This preceptorship of भगवान् is very well-known in the story of Haya-siras (i.e. हयग्रीव ) : "O King! Hari, as Haya-griva, (the Horse-faced God) rescued the वेदा-s from the Nether-worlds and taught them to Brahma. Then He re-assumed His own form." This is known also from the texts like the following : "In times of yore all the Vedँs were brought back from the रसातल ."

## 496 उत्तरः
The rescuer. He rescued Brahma and others frm the trouble of Asuras. He is Uththara, because He rescued Brahma and others from the trouble of the असुरा-s. "Thus praised by the gods, भगवान् , the multi-faced Lord gave up His sleep and became ready to do the work of gods."

## 497 गोपतिः
The master of all words. "He is the Master of all speech, both in the form of the वेदा-s and spoken languages. So does the Hayagrंva Manthra say : "Unto the Master of all speech."

## 498 गोप्ता
The Saviour. Thus He protects all kinds of learning as ' गोप्ता'. His Manthra reads : "To Him-Who is the Lord of all learning".

## 499 ज्ञानगम्यः
He who is to be realised by knowledge. "Meditation should be done on the Supreme Horse-faced Lord, Who is the Master of all speech." "The affix 'yath' comes after a root which ends in a labial letter preceded by a short 'a'."

## 500 पुरातनः
The Ancient. This revelation of learning is done not only now, but in every Kalpa (aeon)."After the words 'सायम् ' chiram (after a long time) etc., and after indeclinables expressing time, there are the affixes 'thyu' and 'thyul'; and their augment is 'thuth'.

## 501 शरीरभूतभृत्
The bearer of the Tattvas as his bodies. भगवान् is शरीर भूतभृत् , because He supports all the तत्वा-s (or Reals) which are (twenty-four in number) all of which are His bodies. "That is His head." "His head was the Sky along with the stars and the deities." Beginning from this श्लोक the whole passage may be studied, the last श्लोक of which is as follows: "His head was the Sky along with the stars and the deities." Beginning from this श्लोक the whole passage may be studied, the last slओka of which is as follows: "Assuming the head of a horse and surrounded by diverse forms."

## 502 भोक्ता
The Enjoyer. "The great face of the horse that was described by you before pertains to विष्णु Who consumes the Havya and कव्य and Who is in the North-east Ocean." He is भोक्ता. (हव्यन् oblation or offering to the gods. काव्यन् oblation of food to deceased ancestors).

## 503 कपीन्द्रो
The Lord of the monkeys. Then in times of yore भगवान् came as राम to promote the performance of sacrificial acts laid down in the वेदा-s which were rescued and taught by Him before (as हयग्रीव ). When He incarnated Himself as राम playfully assuming a human body which was entirely different from His own essential nature. He was the Indra for the gods who were his servitors and who had assumed the forms of monkays which were different in a greater degree to their nature. So Bhagavँn is called कपीन्द्र . "Desirous of doing good to the people. The Lord of the Universe Himself came as राम and He was surrounded and waited upon by gods who had taken the forms of monkeys."

## 504 भूरिदक्षिणः
The giver of liberal remunerations. In order to instruct the world by example He himself as master conducted many sacrifices such as Asvamedha and others in which gifts were liberally given. In order to instruct the world by example He himself as the master conducted many sacrifices such as अश्वमेध and others in which gifts were liberally given. So He is भूरिदक्षिणः . "After having performed hundreds of horse-sacrifices&.. ( राम would return to the world of Para Brahman)."

## 505 सोमपः
The drinker of the Soma (juice). In those sacrifices, श्री राम drank the juice of the सोम plant. ( सोम Name of a plant the most important ingredient in ancient sacrificial offerings.)

## 506 अमृतपः
The drinker of Ambrosia. "Whatever oblation is offered in sacrifices as prescribed in the वेदा-s along with the recitation of the मन्त्रs, the god of fire transforms it into Ambrosia and gives in to विष्णु .". "Indeed I am the enjoyer in all sacrifices and also the master (who bestows the fruits thereof)." भगवान् is Amrutha-pah since He drinks the Nectar into which shape the sacrificial offering has been transformed. Or Amritha-pah can be interpreted as the Protector of Amritha. भगवान् Himself is the Amrutha and He protects it for the enjoyment in the Transcendental World for those who follow the path shown by Him in the discharge of daily duties. (Here the enjoyment of भगवान् is taken as Nectar). "In the third world where the देवाs drink the nectar and shine." "He is the bridge for the Amrutha." (i.e. the procurer of nectar). "Whose shadow is Ambrosia."

## 507 सोमः
The nectar. 'He is सोम , because He is sweet like nectar not only to Himself, but also to those who enjoy Him. The word 'सोम ' signifies nectar. "In the Heavens, the third world from this Earth, there was सोम (nectar)." "He is indeed like Ambrosia." "राम ! By great austerities and by highly virtuous acts. Thou hast been obtained by King Dasarattha like the nectar by the gods." "Those who saw जनार्दन did not become satiate on seeing Him like those who taste the nectar." "(Brahman is) replete with tranquility and immortal (Amrutha)".

## 508 पुरुजित्
The Conqueror of many. He is Purujith since He conquers all (as stated by वाल्मीकि ) "राम conquers people by truthfulness, the poort by gifts, the elders by service, and being a warrior He conquers His enemies with the bow."

## 509 पुरुसत्तमः
He who remains with the great. भगवान् is पुरुसत्तमः , because He ever remains with great devotees like हनुमान् and others who are always desirous of drinking the ocean of His nectar-like qualities Vide : "O King (राम )! My love for Thee is very great and it is firmly planted in Thee. O Warrior! My devotion to Thee is even more steady. I cannot think of going anywhere else (leaving this world where Thou hast enslaved me)." (हनुमान् ) "O Warrior! As long as the story of राम stands in this world".

## 510 विनयः
The subduer. Even मारीच and others are being subdued by राम by His qualities such as valour etc. So He is Vinaya.

## 511 जयः
He who is conquered. He is conquered (i.e. made submissive) by those who have resorted to Him. Theefore He is Jayah. Vide : "I am to be commanded by sages (i.e. I am at their disposal)." "Then by the great gods नारायण was directed."

## 512 सत्यसंधः
He whose promises are true. His promises to them are always true (i.e. carried out). So He is Sathya-sandhah. (Sathya=true, संन्धा =promise). O सीता ! I would rather give up My life or even you as well as लक्षमण . But never will I break My promise, especially that which has been made to the Brahmins." "He is ever true to His word and has His senses under control."

## 513 दाशार्हः
He who deserves the gifts. 'दास ' is gift. He is दाशार्हः , because He is fit to receive the gifts by the devotees of their own selves or fit for surrendering His own self to them. Or taken with reference to भगवान् श्री कृष्ण , the name दाशार्हः may be interpreted as the descendant of दाशार्हः (i.e. यादवा Clan). The affix 'ach' comes after the verb 'arh' (to respect) when the object is in composition with it. The word 'Mahatha' (525) and others also come under this rule.the quality of Saththva. 'सात्वता ' signifies the act of the person or the Scripture that is followed by him. सात्वता s are the भागवता-s. Their Lord is सात्वताम पतिः . By this derivation the meaning of the following श्लोक is suggested : "O the Chief of the सात्वता -s ! I created the सात्वता- s who perform their acts with a spirit of non-attachment to their fruits in a dedicated way. Since I am realised by those endowed with such knowledge. I am Myself a सात्वता ." Or the यादवा-s are called सात्वता s, and being their Lord, भगवान is सात्वता पतिः . The affix 'nich' has been added to form the word 'सात्वता ' in the sense of 'he does' or 'says'. "The last vowel with consonant, if any, that follows it, is elided when the affixes 'ishta', 'iman' and 'ईया-s' follow. 

## 514 सात्वतां
पतिः The Lord of the Saatvats. 'Sath' is the Supreme Brahman or the quality of सात्व . "The affix 'mathup' comes after a word in the first case in construction in the sense of 'whose it is' or 'in whom it is.' "The letter 'va' is substituted for 'ma' in 'mathup' when the word so formed is a Noun." "The word-form ending in 'th' or in 's' is called 'bha' when an affix with the force of 'mathup' (whose it is or in whom it is) follows." 'सात्वान् ' is one who knows Brahman or one who is possessed of

## 515 जीवः
He who makes them alive. He gives life to the भगवान् by preventing them from commiting acts that will bring about their ruin and makes them lead a life of Bliss by doing service to Him. Vide : "भगवान् is the very embodiment of Beatitude and is worsipped by all the three worlds. O Devi! He cannot bear to see His devotees suffer."

## 516 विनयिता
The Saviour.He protects them with love and affection as princes.

## 517 साक्षी
The Observer. In order to protect them He is always closely observing them. So He is called साक्षी.

## 518 मुकुन्दः
The salvation-giver. He bestows the World of Release on them when they pray to Him for it with supreme and single-minded devotion. "From the two words 'मुक्तिं ददीती i', the word 'Mukunda' has been irregularly formed under the 'प्रिषोदर' rule. (Note : The elision and mutation and augment of letters to be seen in प्रिषोदर and other words, though not found in treatises on Grammar, are valid to that extent and n the mode as taught by the usage of the sages. (The word 'Hamsa' is formed by the augment of a letter (sa after han); 'Simha' from 'hims' by the transposition of the letter; 'गूढात्म ' by mutation of letters and प्रिषोदर by the disappearance of letters).

## 519 अमितविक्रमः
He of boundless valour. He is endowed with supreme power to be the supporter of all Realities such as Prakruthi and others, which (power) is the object of meditation, worship and contemplation of His devotees. So He is Amitha-vikrama. Vide in Paushkara : "He is time, Fire; He lies on various objects and lives in the Nether-worlds; He is without form and is all-pervasive. He is known by the name of आधार-शक्ति (the power that is the supporter of all Realities). He assumes whatever form He likes and therefore is in divers forms."

## 520 अम्भोनिधिः
He who has placed Himself under the waters. He has kept His form as a Tortoise in the waters of the पाताळलोक as the base plank to support the entire Universe. Here is the Manthra about Him in this form : "Unto Him of unlimited power and strength Who supports the worlds in the form of a Tortoise."

## 521 अनन्तात्मा
The inner Soul of Ananta. On that कूर्म He stands as the Iner Soul of Anantha, the serpent-king, who is the pillar that bears the Universe. In श्री Jaya (Akhya Samhitha) it is said : "One must place in his meditation on the आधार शक्ति (the embodiment of all-supporting power), the Lord of Anantha Who is flawless, Who possesses and effulgent body, Who is surrounded by hundreds of flames and Who bears in His hands Sankha, Chakra and गदा " "Him who has in his hands the discus and the ploughshare and who bows before Him; when compared with Whom all other great gods are inferior."

## 522 महोदधिशयः
He who is reclining in the vast ocean. The same Lord at the time of the final deluge, lies on the couchlike serpent-body of Anantha in that ocean. "The affix 'ach' comes after the verb 'si' (to lie down) when in composition with a case-inflected word indicating location, in the Locative case." 'Bhu:-sayah' (634 and other such names also are formed under this rule.

## 523 अन्तकः
He who brings about the end of all. He is called Anthaka because He causes the end of all things. The affix 'nvul' has been added to indicate the causal form of the verb in 'he does.' "At the time of the end of the world, Thou art soon on the आदि शेष in the waters of the deep." Vide in the वैष्णव पुराण : "(भगवान् संकर्षण as) शेष lies at the bottom of the Nether-worlds being worshipped by all the gods." "Who can describe His valour on whose head this entire Earth rendered red by the lustre of the sparking gems of His hoods shines like a garland of flowers." "The गन्धर्वा-s and the अप्सरा-s, the किन्नरा-s and सिद्धा-s, and the great उरग-s none of them can reach the end of (the greatness of) His qualities. So He is called Anantha." "His valour and greatness, essential nature and form cannot be known or described even by gods." "At the end of the Kalpa (aeon), from his mouths comes out rudra with संकर्षण as His आत्मा glowing with the flames of the poisonous fire and he consumes the three worlds.". And texts like these.

## 524 अजः
He who is signified by the letter A. भगवान् is to be meditated upon as being signified by the letter 'a' which is the origin of the प्रणव and as being at the head of all Realities. He is Aja, because He appears in our knowledge as being indicated by the letter 'a'. "नारायण is the Supreme Lord Who occupies the highest place amongst all the तत्वा-s (Realities) and Who is signified by the letter 'a' which is the origin for the word प्रणव (i.e. ॐकार ) (which is invariably pronounced at the beginning of the recitation of the Veda and which has also a definite place at the end of the recitation)." परमात्म is the twenty-sixth and the highest Reality signified by the letter, 'a'. जीवात्म is the twenty-fifth तत्वा and is signified by the letter 'm'. The other twenty-four तत्वा s are non-sentient and they are : Prakruthi (the Primordial Matter), Mahath, अहंकार , the mind, the five organs of sense (ज्ञानेन्द्रिया eye, ear, tongue, nose and skin), the five organs of action (कर्मेन्द्रियs hands, legs, the organs of speech, of excretion and of generation in men and women; the five तन्मात्राs sound, touch, form, taste and smell; and the five elements ether, air, fire water and earth. These twenty four तत्वाs are signified by the twenty-four consonants respectively beginning with 'k' and ending with 'bh').

## 525 महार्हः
He who is worthy of worship. Amongst these तत्वा-s, भगवान् is the Superior तत्वा Who is to be worshipped by means of the प्रणव and by offering one's soul to Him. (Maham means worship). "The great secret which the gods are keeping as taught by the great Upanishad is that the जीव is to be offered to भगवान् , the Supreme Brahman by means of the प्रणव , (in which the first letter 'a' signifies परमात्मा and the last letter 'm'जीवात्म.)". "To Thee, the ब्रह्मन् of great effulgence, by the Manthra 'ॐ' (I offer myself)."

## 526 स्वाभाव्यः
He who is to be meditated upon by those who belong to him. Thus by this Manthra (viz. प्राणव ), all the souls, which are His property, should inevitably meditate upon Him with love, he being the Master of all of them. "If you desire the highest goal of life and the means of attaining it you should understand clearly that you are the servant and that ईश्वर is the Master and that this relationship is eternal and a natural one". "There is no other reason for the Supreme Being to be the ruler of the Universe." Or He is स्वाभाव्य , because the relationship between the Lord and the souls as Master and servant is eternal and natural and must be meditated upon as such. "The affix 'nyath' comes after a root that ends in the letter 'u' long or short, when the sense is that of necessity.

## 527 जितामित्रः
The Conqueror of the foes. Egotism, the feeling that all things are mine (and not God's), and the desires in the devotees are enemies (amithra) for the understanding of the secret delineated above. भगवान् vanquishes all of them for the benefit of His devotees. So He is जितामित्रते Conqueror of the foes. This is a well-known fact that desires and the like are the enemies. श्री कृष्ण reveals this fact to Arjuna in the भगवत् गीत a in six श्लोका-s the first and the last of which read thus : "This (cause of sin) is desire as well as anger born from the Guखa called Rँjँs." "O long-armed Arjuna! Put an end to this invincible enemy namely काम (desire)."

## 528 प्रमोदनः
He who delights. Those who are connected with Him experience a joy when they think of this fact that their enemies (desire and anger) have been vanquished by भगवान् . So He is प्रामोदन (the Joy-giver). The Kapila Incarnation of भगवान् .

## 529 आनन्दः
He who is Bliss . Next the Incarnation of भगवान् as Kapila is dealt with. भगवान् is called आनन्द because He is endowed with a Bliss which is beyond the region of thought and word and about the greatness of which a detailed investigation has been made in the आनन्द -valli ( section of the तैतरीय Upanishad) and conclusion arrived at. "The affix 'ach' (a) comes after the words 'arsa' etc. in the sense of 'mathup' (i.e. possession).

## 530 नन्दनः
The Blis-giver. भगवान् confers that Bliss on the Released souls in the state of release described above and makes them happy.

## 531 नन्दः
He who is replete (with things bliss ful) भगवान् is noted for His uprightness towards His devotees from the time they begin to approach Him up to the time of their attainment of Him. So He is सत्य- धर्म .

## 532 सत्यधर्मा
He is true in His acts. By this superior greatness of His, भगवान् pervades through the three वेदा-s as their main topic. So He is called Thrivikrama. Vide : "Triad is the term by which the three वेदा-s are referred to by the great seers. Thou traversest all the three of them (by Thy greatness) and so Thou art known by the name of Thrivikrama." "In praise of Whom all the वेदा-s speak in one voice." "नारायण is the main topic dealt with by the वेदा-s."

## 533 त्रिविक्रमः
He who traverses or pervades the three Vedas. भगवान् is महर्षिः since (in His incarnation as Kapila) He realised the three वेदा-s by intuitive perception as detailed above. "One should think of Him as speaking through his mouths the ruk and other वेदा-s." This is the way in which he is to be meditated upon. "Kapila, who was a seer from his very birth." "He is the propounder of the संख्या System and is spoken of as the Great Seer."

## 534 महर्षिः
The great seer. He is Mahaeshih since he realised the three Vedas by intutive perception as detailed above. भगवान् is महर्षिः since (in His incarnation as Kapila) He realised the three वेदा-s by intuitive perception as detailed above.

## 535 कपिलाचार्यः
He who is 'Kapila' (of brown complexion) and also an Acharya (teacher) He is of brown (kapila) complexion and a Teacher (आचार्य). Here is the form in which He has to be meditated upon : "He Who is possessed of a lustre like the burning and smokeless ember, and has Sankha and Padma beads in his hand." He is आचार्य , because He has collected together all the knowledge with regard to the तत्वा-s (Realities) pertaining to his system of Philosphy. The Manthra describing Him says : "To Him Who spread the knowledge of His system." The word Kapila is derived from the root 'Kabr' (to colour). "The affix 'ilach' comes after the verb 'Kam' (to desire) or 'Kabr' (to colour) and the 'm' or 'br' is changed to 'p' (Kam+ilach=Kapila).

## 536 कृतज्ञः
He who remembers the good deed done. The sons of King सागर had offended the Sage Kapila by whom they were reduced to ashes. But later when Amsuman, the grandson of सागर came before Kapila and bowed before him with respect, Kapila remembered only that good act. So he is called Kruthagjna. Kapila was not only pleased with the virtuous act of Amsuman, but also wanted to confer a boon on him. So he said to him, "Choose a boon." "Amsuman approached Kapila and bowing before him with respect praised him. Then Lord Kapila said to Him. "Choose a boon."

## 537 मेदिनीपतिः
The lord of the Earth. "All the Earth belongs to the omniscient Lord वासुदेव . Taking the form of Kapila, He always bears the Earth." (These are the words of Brahma to the gods in the रामायण .)

## 538 त्रिपदः
The propounder of the three Tattvas. He is known as Thri-pada since, He has the three तत्वा-s which are to be revealed to the world. The three तत्वा-s are भोक्ता (the enjoyer, the individual soul), भोग्य (the object of enjoyment, the non-sentient matter), and the ruler ( ईश्वर ). Vide : "Having assumed the form of Kapila, I am going to reveal the three Realities for the benefit of all beings in the worldthe three तत्वा-s namely प्राधान (non-sentient matter). पुराण (the जीव ), and परमात्वा . Or the name Thripada signifies the प्रणव which has three words which denote Him. (The three letters A U M of the प्रणव are treated as three words.) Or Thripada refers to वराह-अवतार "I assumed the form of वराह (Boar) and had three humps."

## 539 त्रिदशाध्यक्षः
The saviour of the gods. भगवान् is the friend of Brahma and other gods in distress at the time of deluge. (Thri-दश Three times ten, i.e. thirty. The word 'Thridasa' signifying thirty gods in round number actually refers to the thirty-three gods, (not including Brahma, विष्णु and Siva), the twelve आदित्या, the eight वासु , the eleven रुद्रा-s and the two Asvins.)

## 540 महाशृङ्गः
The big-tusked Varaha. He has a large tusk to the tip of which the Earth is sticking. "Thou art the single-tusked वराह (incarnation as Boar)." "O Lord! This entire Earth having its place at the tip of Thy tusk, appears like the leaf of a lotus-pond (of sport)."

## 541 कृतान्तकृत्
He who slew him who was like Yama. भगवान् is कृतान्त-कृत् , since He killed हिरण्याक्ष who was like Yama. Vide : "The great Asura, हिरण्याक्ष was killed by Him".

## 542 महावराहः
The Great Boar. "The great वराहः भगवान् , Who has eyes like full-blown lotuses and the complexion like that of blue-lotus petal, lifted the Earth from the रसतल (Nether-world) by His tusk and emerged as a great blue mountain."

## 543 गोविन्दः
He who rescued the Earth. "The Earth had disappeared in time of yore and was secreted in a cave. I rescued Her. So I am known as 'गोविन्दा'(Go=Earth, Vinsa=rescuer).

## 544 सुषेणः
He who is equipped with an efficient army-like body. Another secret is revealed here with reference to भगवान् in His Transcendent Form. He has a charming body which is composed of Suddha Saththva and which is delineated by the पन्चोपनिषद् मन्त्रा-s. This body is like a powerful army to Him since, it helps Him to conquer the souls in bondage, the souls released and the Eternal Angels. As His body serves Him as a सुषेण (good army), He is called सुषेण .

## 545 कनकाङ्गदी
He who is adorned by armlets of gold. भगवान् is ever adorned by celestial ornaments of which the armlets mentioned here are but an example. These ornaments also are composed of that celestial matter (Suddha Saththva) which set off the beauty of the body described earlier. The word 'Kanaka' in कनकाङ्गदी is only suggestive of the unique and fine substances which are of a transcendental nature and are different from the material of this world which is composed of the three गुमाs सत्व ,रजस् and तमs. The suffix 'ini' at the end of the word 'कनकाङ्गदी ' indicates the constant association of those ornaments of gold with the परमात्म.

## 546 गुह्यः
He who is concealed. H is called Guhya since, He is concealed by virtue of the possession of a body composed of the celestial materials which fact is revealed by the great Upanishads referred to as पञ्चोपनिषद् earlier. (Just as the material body in this world is composed of the पञ्च-भूता-s (five elements), the bodies of the परमात्मा and others in श्री वैकुण्ठ are composed of fine celestial things composed of Suddha-saththva known as पञ्चशक्तीs and which are indicated by the five मन्त्र-बीजाs which go by the name of पञ्चोपनिषद्s. It has to be said that the affix 'ya' is added optionally after the roots 'sams' 'duh' and 'guh'.

## 547 गभीरः
He who is deep or mysterious. He is deep because of His inscrutable and superior nature which is revealed by the पञ्चोपनिषद्s (mentioned earlier). By coming into contact with Him even the bound souls, defiled by the beginningless Nescience, become clean like the muddy water which becomes clean by its contact with the 'kataka' seed. Such being the case, need it be said that भगवान् Who is ever effulgent by nature will be more so. The words 'गभीर ' and 'गम्भीर ' have been formed irregularly. The affix 'ंran comes after the root 'गाः', the 'm' or which is changed to 'oh'. Optionally the root receives the augment 'num'.

## 548 गहनः
The unfathomable. The ocean cannot be said to be knee-deep even though one is able to see things on its bed because of the clear water which is translucent. (In the same way परमात्मा cannot be fully understood even though His qualities are understood to a certain extent by the Upanishads).

## 549 गुप्तः
He who is hidden. He is kept concealed by the earlier आचार्य who were aware of His greatness by His Grace.

## 550 चक्रगदाधरः
The bearer of the DIscus and Mace. Where and in what manner has He been concealed? रामायण says only this much about the Superior nature of परमात्मा : "The Creator is far beyond the region of तमस् (i.e. Prakruthi-mandala) and He bears the Conch, the Discus and the Mace." The same is repeated here as Chakra गदा धरः . It does clearly declare that His weapons are etenal and celestial by nature and are composed of the divine material called Pancha-sakthi in the same way as He has a body and ornaments, eternal and celestial by nature.

## 551 वेधाः
The providence. In this way भगवान् always provides (His devotees) with great, unlimited and varied objects of splendour. So His name is Providence (वेदः ). "The Supreme Being is in the region beyond the Universe of matter (Thamas)." "The affix 'as' comes after the root 'धा ' (to hold) preceded by 'vi'; and 'विधा' is replaced by 'वेधा '. (vi+धा+asi=वेधा+asi=वेधाः.)

## 552 स्वाङ्गः
He who has the marks of sovereignty which are his own. In that place He eternally has all the paraphernalia (marks of Sovereignty) like the umbrella, the चामर and other things indicative of His sovereignty which are His own and unique.

## 553 अजितः
He who has the city Ajitaa by name He has a city which is composed of that celestial matter (Suddha-saththva) and which is not under the sway of birth and death that pertain to the material world of Prakruthi, and which goes by the name of 'अजिता '. So He is called 'Ajithah'. Or "The affix 'ach' is added after 'arsa' and other words."

## 554 कृष्णः
The dark hued. He is कृष्ण as He has a body composed of the Suddha saththva which has a fascinating complexion dark like that of a blue cloud. "The affix 'nak' comes after the verb ' कृष् ' (to plough) when it means one of the colours." (कृष् +णक् =कृष्ण ). It has been declared by the ancients that the body of भगवान् in His incarnations as वराह and the like is composed of the same material (Suddha-Saththva). "O Arjuna; the son of पार्थ! I become a big plough of black iron and plough this Earth. Since my colour is black I am known as 'कृष्ण'." All these as mentioned above are described clearly in श्री विष्णु तत्व : "There is one important Sakthi in the form of My body which is fivefold. Even though भगवान् is endowed with all kinds of शक्तीs (powers), He, because of His compassion, which is natural to Him, does not give them up at any time. परमेष्टी , पुमान् , विश्वः ,निवृत्तिः and Sarvah-- these are the five शक्तीस् of the परमात्मा." Their real nature is described as being twofold and then it is continued : "O Best of Brahmins; The Incarnations of the Supreme Being as Mathsya, कूर्म ,वराह and so on are only made with these शक्तीs, but not in any other way which will be contrary to them."

## 555 दृढः
he who is in a gross form. From out of this eternal form of His, भगवान् assumes by means of this Sakthi the व्यूह (Emanation) for blessing His devotees. "Drudha' is derived from the roots 'drh' and 'drhi' (to grow). 'Drudha' in the sense of 'firm' and 'strong' has been irregularly formed as the past passive participle."

## 556 संकर्षणः
He Who draws others near Him. Who (assumes this gross form)? संकर्षण. The मूलाs say about Him thus : "In this world, He draws within Himself both the Chith and the Achith in the same way; He is संकर्षण . His power of attraction is uniform."

## 557 अच्युतः

## 558 वरुणः
He who envelops. "By Whom are covered the Ether, the Svarga and the Earth." "By Him all this is enveloped." So He is called वरुण (Who covers everything). The word 'वरुण ' is derived from the root 'vrjn' (to envelop). "The affix 'unan' comes after the roots 'kr', 'vr' and 'dr." (वृ +उण =वरुण ).

## 559 वारुणः
He who is with His seekers वारुणः is one who seeks Him as his master. भगवान् n is called वारुणः since, He is always with him. "I also am within them (even as they are within Me.)"

## 560 वृक्षः
He who is the Resort. Like a shady tree, He is possessed of all things that are required by those who resort to Him and He also puts up with hundreds of injuries done by them. So He is वृक्ष (their Resort). वृक्ष is derived from 'vrj' (to seek or resort to). "He is the one Resort for the good and the supreme refuge in distress". "Like an unmoving and firm tree He stands in the Heavens." "There is no doubt that the ripe fruits of all desires will fall from that tree of Brahman Who is eternal and Who is the resort of all." And so on.

## 561 पुष्कराक्षः
He who has nourishing eyes. भगवान् has two eyes which nouriढ the devotees by showering favours on them, So He is पुष्कराक्षः a. The word 'पुष्कर' is formed by adding the affix 'karan' to the root 'पुष् ' (to nourish). It gets the 'kith' affix here.

In this context all that has been said in the Sixth Amsa of विष्णु पुरुष with reference to the derivation of the word ' भगवान् ' must be written here.

## 565 नन्दी
He who has Nanada as His father. The भगवान् Who was संकर्षण in the Vyuha (Emanation) became in the Vibhava Incarnation बलराम and has नन्दगोप as His father. Or He has the joy (आनन्द) of being addicted to 'madhu' (sweet drink) and also of being the beloved of Vallavis (गोप damsels). In this sense, the word is to be taken as 'ँnandं'.

## 566 वनमाली
He who has the Vana-maalaa He is always adorned by the वैजयन्ते Garland which is the presiding Deity over the पञ्च-भुताs and Pancha-तन्त्रा-s (the five elements in their gross and subtle form) all of which are His creations and also over the quality of fragrance. So He is वनमाली .

## 567 हलायुधः
The plough-armed He is हलायुधः since, He like an agriculturist has the plough as the instrument and works for the prosperous growth of the पञ्च-भुता s referred to. "One should recite the name of Balabhadra while engaged in cultivation for the sake of the fertile growth (of the plants)".

"The affix 'Kyap' comes after the roots 'I' stu' etc." Or He is आदित्य , because He is the son of देवकी who was Adithi in her previous birth. The Vaiढखava Dharma states that भगवान् spoke to देवकी as follows : "You are दाक्षायणी (the daughter of दक्ष ) born as Adithi in this world. You are the mother eternal of the world. I confer favours on you."

"The affix 'anan' is the substitute of the final 'u' in the word 'dhanu' in the बहुर्व्रीहि compound."

## 573 खण्डपरशुः
He with the broken axe. भगवान् got the name of Khanda-Parasu since the fight with अdra came to an end with the discharge of the axe by भगवान् . "Then for the destruction of rudra, नर took up a reed and by the recitation of मन्त्रा-s gave new power to it. At once it became an immense axe. It was thrown on rudra with great force.

## 587 संन्यासकृत्

He cuts asunder the bonds in the form of रजोगुण and तमोगुण when acts are performed in a disinterested manner with a spirit of renunciation of desire for the fruit. Here the word 'सन्यास ' signifies the surrender of the burden to the Master. That surrender alone is the remedy for the संसार . This is in accordance with the Sruthi alao : "Those who have acquired the true knowledge (of Thatthva, Hitha and पुरुषार्थ ) by the study of the उपनिषदs, do योग by doing acts renouncing the desire for fruits and giving up the idea that they are the chief agent of the acts. By this process their minds become pure and they practise Bhakthi योग . At the end of their last body they attain the Brahman and become free from all Karma."

## 588 सामः
He who instructs. For that purpose He gives instruction about the means for the control of desire, fear and ager as stated in the गीता : "Having learnt that I am the enjoyer of the fruits of all sacrifices and austerities." The affix 'nich' is added to the root 'Sam' of the tenth Conjugation in the sense of 'he teaches'. The form 'साम ' is got by adding the affix 'ach' to the roots grouped under 'pach'.

## 589 शान्तः
He whose mind is always tranquil. Even though there is every reason for the rise of the ocean of abundant greatness, He is tranquil like a calm and waveless ocean. Pathanjali sings about the greatness of those who have a sight of Him thus : "There is the abandonment of enmity in his presence." A poet of later times (भारवि ) also says the same with reference to व्यास : "व्यास had a charming resplendence which was spreading in all directions and which could be seen with the eye and which burnt all sins and by His sweet looks he made even the wild animals tranquil."

## 590 निष्ठा
The object of concentration. The object of concentration have Him and His body as the object of their meditationbody, which is pure and fascinating.

And ending with. "(He who has realised the state of Brahman and who is tranquil, in spirit, neither grieves nor desires. He is the same to all beings and attains eminent devotion for Me." "But through the exclusive devotion, O Arjuna, it is possible really (to know, to see and to enter into Me. I am like this. "Harasser of foes!")

## 593 शुभाङ्गः
He who os with the eight accessories of yoga. The eight अन्गाs (accessories) of योग beginning with 'Yama' and ending with 'Concentration' which are auspicious on account of the devotion to Him are obtained by His favour. It is He that helps people to begin and complete the meditation on Him. (The eight angas of योग are ; Yama, Niyama, आसन, प्राणयाम , प्रत्याहार ,धारण ", ध्यान and संधी.)

## 594 शान्तिदः
The bestowerof eternal peace. He confers Peace which is in the form of His own Realisation on those who have obtained perfect devotion, and for them there is no longer any fear from rebirth in this world. Vide : "If a person realises the auspicious God Who pervades the Universe, He attains perfect peace." "When a person realises that God Who is the ruler, Who is the grantor of boons, Who is worthy of praise and the Inner Soul, he obtains the highest peace."

## 595 स्रष्टा
The creator. Thus He brings about the release of those who long for release (from संसार ) grants the desires of those who wish to continue in संसार and possess the various things of the world quite in accordance with the Karma that they have accumulated from time immemorial. He is स्रष्टा (the Creator) in this way. "The augment 'am' (a' comes after the 'r' of 'srj' (to create) and 'drs' (to see) when the affix beginning with a 'jhal' (i.e. a mute and the sibilant) follows provided it has no indicatory 'k' (Srj+Trn=sr+a+ja+trn=स्रष्ट्र ).

## 596 कुमुदः
He who is happy. 'Ku' is the world which consists of objects, high and low-like sound touch, etc. which are a source of pleasure for all created beings from Brahma to a tiny blade of grass, In this material world He makes all those beings enjoy those things and Himself feels delighted by that. So He is Kumuda. "The Individual soul which is powerless is kept bound to this world as an enjoyer." "परमात्मा and जीवात्म are both of them birthless; One is the ruler and the other ruled; one is omniscient and the other of little knowledge." "The words 'मूल-विभूज ' (a chariot), 'Kumuda' (lotus) and the rest should be included in the subdivision of words formed by the affix 'ka'. (This is the वार्तिक under the सूत्र "तुण्डा-शोकयोः " etc. (अष्टाद्यायी 3-2-5).

## 597 कुवलेशयः
The Controller of the Jivas who wander in this world as masters of their bodies. The Controller of the जीवा-s who wander in this world as masters of their bodies. (This name is interpreted by dividing it into several parts as : Ku+vala+ंsa+yँ. 'Ku' means the world or in an evil way; 'vala' is derived from the verb 'valanthi' which means wander. The word 'कुवलाs' signifies the जीवा-s who are wandering in this world or who are going about in an evil way. 'ईश ' means ruler. This refers to the जीवा-s who think they are the masters of their bodies and Indriyas. 'या' comes from the verb यति ' (goes). This refers to परमात्म . Thus the word कुवलेशय is the name of परमात्मा who goes about controlling the जीवा-s who are wandering in this world in an evil way till the end of their worldly existence thinking that they are the masters of their own bodies and sense-organs.

## 598 गोहितः
He Who manipulates the world. 'Go' means Prakruthi (the Primordial Matter) which is like the field where the seeds for the growth of संसार (for the जीवा (are sown). 'Hitha' means the manipulator or controller परमात्म , as the Supreme ruler, controls the Prakruthi, the field in which the seeds for the growth of the worldly existence for the Jivas are sown. "(One should meditate) on that Lord Who presides over every thing that is the cause of the world like Prakruthi etc., in whom all things merge at the time of dissolution, and from Whom they emerge and disperse (at the time of creation)." "This Prakruthi, which has neither beginning nor end produces things like a mother and nourishes them." "This Universe is controlled by Him and all objects of enjoyment are produced by Him."

## 599 गोपतिः
The lord of the Celestial world. भगवान् is the Lord of the Svarga also which is the place of enjoyment (for the जीवा-s).

## 600 गोप्ता
The Protector. भगवान् is the गोप्ता (Protector) since, He is the protector of the world and dispenser of the fruits of Karma (good or bad) which are going on revolving like a wheel.

## 601 वृषभाक्षः
The Dharma-axle. The protection of the world is done by Him through Dharma. 'वृषभ ' signifies Dharma which showers the fruits of actions. He is the axle that supports the wheel of Dharma in संसार and showers the fruits in accordance with Dharma.

## 602 वृषप्रियः
Dharma-lover. Dharma is of two kinds Pravruththi and Nivruththi. Pravrithi Dharma helps the Jivas to continue in the world whereas the Nivruththidharma brings about their redemption. Since, both of them are dear to भगवान् , He is वृष -priya. The purpose of these (Vedic) injunctions is only to please Him. This has been established by the Brahma सुत्रा-s as follows. "The fruit proceeds from the परब्रह्मन् . There are appropriate reasons for the same." द्रमिडाचार्य also echoes the same idea. "It is only with the object of obtaining the fruit that all are trying to please the परमात्म by means of Dharma or virtuous acts. The Sआsthraic code also lays down that the acquisition of His pleasure is enough for the attainment of the desired fruit." Therefore all other schools of thought holding views that differ from this are to be disregardedviews which say that the cause of the fruit is karma (action) or its latent impression, or power. Or अपूर्व (a unique substance) or भावन (psychic effect), or Vidhi (Destiny).

## 603 अनिवर्ती
He who does not turn away (those who are inclined to come back to this world.) If some are attached to Pravruththi dharma, भगवान् does not stop them from coming into this world through the path of the Pithrs beginning with Smoke. That is the cause for the continuance of this संसार . Vide : "Smoke, night, then the dark fortnight, the six months that constitute the दक्षिणाय (the winter solstice)there is a path which is characterised by all these. The योगि who are inclined to come back to this world.) "When the fruit of the Karma has been enjoyed in the other world, he comes back to this world with the balance of Karma to his credit." In the above texts and others this has been well discussed and conclusion arrived at.

## 604 निवृत्तात्मा
He Who is the Atma of those who practise Nivritti Dharma. He who is the आत्म of those who practise Nivruththi Dharma. निवृत्ता are those who follow the path of Nivruththi dharma which take them to मोक्ष . भगवान् is the आत्म of those people also. So He is निवृत्तात्म .

## 605 संक्षेप्ता
He who limits. It is the nature of भगवान् to limit the field of the light of knowledge of those who practise the Pravruththi-dharma. Vide "The power, known as the क्षेत्रज्ञन , acquires, on account of its being covered by that (Avidya or Karma), all the ever curing miseries (belonging to the circuit of mundane existence), O thou, protector of earth."

## 606 क्षेमकृत्
He who does what is good. He does what is good for those who follow the Nivruththi dharma by removing the obstructions to their knowledge.

## 607 शिवः
- The Auspicious. He does what is auspicious for all whether they desire the enjoyment of worldly pleasures or whether they seek release. He is Siva. "He is the cause of the bondage of worldly existence and also of release therefrom." "The God rules ever the world of the Pithrs." "He is auspicious for those that do auspicious things, and inauspicious for those that do inauspicious things." Then follow some names that establish this auspicious nature of भगवान्

## 608 श्रीवत्सवक्षाः
He with the Srivatsa on His chest. On His chest He has the श्रीवत्स (mole) which is the symbol of His good fortune in being the beloved Consort of लक्षमी, which fact distinguishes Him from all other things that are ruled by Him. He is श्रीवत्सवक्षाः . Vide :-- "He has श्रीवत्सः on His chest."

## 609 श्रीवासः
The abode of lakshmi. "He is ever with श्री " What is suggested by this statement (in the रामायण ) is declared by this name श्रीवासः . He is the Kalpaka-tree garden for लक्षमी where she is ever sporting according to Her Pleasure.

## 610 श्रीपतिः
The consort of Lakshmi. भगवान् is the eternally self-chosen and suitable Consort of लक्षमी as was सीता in the case of राम , Vide : "सीता was the equal of राम in nature, age and character." "भूमी देवि and लक्षमी are thy Consorts." "she is the ruler of this Universe and the Consort of विष्णु ."

## 611 श्रीमतां
वरः The foremost amongst the Opulent. भगवान् is ever the object of the ardent full and loving glances of लक्षमी whereas Brahma and others are but the object of a casual glance of Hers for a moment. Vide : "लक्षमी , as she emerged from the Milk-ocean, was bedecked with white garlands and garments, and her body was beautified by all ornaments. Even as all the gods where looking with wide open eyes. ढe approached विष्णु and took Her seat on His chest. 'O मैत्रेय ! When लक्षमी looked at those gods from Her seat on the chest of Hari, all of them at once experienced immense joy." Thus, He is the foremost amongst the opulent.

## 612 श्रीदः
The glory -giver. भगवान् gives लक्षमी the glory of the supreme love which is eternal, freढ and spontaneous श्रीधः . That is to say He is Her life itself. Her nature is portrayed thus by वाल्मीकी in the words of लक्षमणा "O राम ! Neither can सीता be without you, nor I. If we are alive (without you), it will be just for a moment, even like a pair of fish that have been taken out of water." "she is ever inseparable from विष्णु ." "सीता cannot be without me even as the lustre cannot be without the Sun." (says राम ). "Just as radiance cannot be separated from the Sun. I cannot be separated from राम "(says सीता ).

## 613 श्रीशः
The Lord of Sri. He is the cause of the glory of Lakshmi also. भगवान् is called श्रीशः , because He is the cause of the glory of लक्षमी also. Vide : "He is the supreme glory of Sri Herself." Or He is श्रीशः because He has श्री as His ruler. It is she that guides Him in the various acts of His in different conditions. "( लक्षमी is ever with भगवान् ) either as His innate qualities in His Transcendental Form, or in a delightful form in His body, or as His support by Her essential nature or as a devout servant." "The ruler of the individual souls, of Prakruthi and of the ruler Himself" is one of the well-known names of लक्षमी .

## 614 श्रीनिवासः
The comtiguous support of lakshmi. He is ever Her support like the Kalpaka tree for a celestial creeper.

## 615 श्रीनिधिः
The abode of Sri. लक्षमी has been placed in भगवान् like a gem-studded jewel in a casket, Hence He is श्रीनिधिः .

## 616 श्रीविभावनः
He who owes His greatness to Lakshmi. लक्षमी is the main cause for the well-known greatness of the Lord. He is श्री विभावन since, His greatness is manifested by Her. So it is described by वाल्मीकि : "That splendour which is श्री राम is beyond all measure, for the daughter of Janaka, सीता is His."

## 617 श्रीधरः
The Bearer of Sri . Just as the gem bears its lustre, the flower its fragrance, the moon her moonlight, and the nectar its sweetness. विष्णु bears लक्षमी by an innate relationship. So He is श्रीधरः . "It will be impossible for राम to abandon सीता even as the fame of a virtuous man cannot be abandoned by him."

## 618 श्रीकरः
He who makes lakshmi follow him लक्षमी remains as a suitable consort to Him in His Para or Transcendental Aspect. He makes her incarnate Herself in a suitable form when He comes down into this world in His Incarnations as व्युह (Emanations). "when He takes a divine body, she also assumes a celestial body." "The affix 'tha' comes after the verb 'krjn (to make) when the object is in composition with it denoting cause, habit and agreeableness (as in the case of hair in the natural order). 'तीर्थकरः ' (696) and other words also come under this rule.

## 619 श्रेयः-श्रीमान्
- He that Has Lakshmi Who, is resorted to for reaping the good. लक्ष्मी is called श्रेयः श्री since She has to be resorted to for the attainment of all goals of human endeavour. (श्रेयः =the goal of human endeavour; 'श्री'=She Who is to be resorted to.) Vide - "Maithili (सीता ), the daughter of Janaka, is surely bent upon showing Her graciousness to those who make obeisance to Her. O राक्षसी-s! she is capable of protecting us from this danger." (त्रिजटा to the राक्षसी-s ). "She bestows bodily health, wealth, destruction of enemies and happiness." "She is the grantor of the fruit of release from bondage." "From Whom I shall get gold, cows, horses and sons." "लक्ष्मी , Who is worshipped by the gods (for getting their ends accomplished) or Who is loved by नारायण Himself, and Who is bounteous in Her gifts." Such indeed are the Scriptural Texts about लक्ष्मी .

## 620 लोकत्रयाश्रयः
He Who is the Resort for all the three worlds. He like a father is the one resort of all beings along with लक्ष्मी Who is the mother of the world. Vide : "Thou art the Mother of all the worlds, and Hari, the God of all gods, is the father."

## 624 नन्दिः
He who is delighted. He is Nandi since He is delighted by being ever prosperous by virtue of His being with Her at all times, at all places and in all ways). "The affix 'in' is added to all verbs." (Nand+in=Nandi).

## 625 र्ज्योतिर्गणेश्वरः
The Lord of the hosts of lustrous deities. He is Jyothir-गणेश्वर because He is being served always by hosts of eternal servitors like शेष and शेषासन who are agreeable to both of them and who are themselves lustrous. Here the word 'ज्योतिः ' signifies the retinue of नित्य सूरी-s who are ever-effulgent by nature. Vide : "Wise men desire to attain the world of the radiant souls." "Where the ancient साध्य देवा reside." शेष आदिशेष ; शेषासन विश्वक्सेन , the Lord's Commander-in-chief, 'who takes in only that which remains after having been offered to the Lord first. These are all known as नित्य सूरी . Thus far the supreme nature of भगवान् to its highest extent has been portrayed. Now we proceed to delineate the quality of amiability of भगवान् to its farthest limit. This in fact is considered a topic of greatest secrecy.

## 626 विजितात्मा
He whose mind has been conquered. भगवान् has a mind which is self-willed and delectable that is fascinating even to लक्षमी . But He is easily won over and becomes favourably disposed towards those who bow before Him. So He is विजितात्मा possessed of a mind that has been conquered by His devotees.

## 627 विधेयात्मा
He who is of submissive nature. It is His essential nature to be at the disposal of His devotees to such an extent that He can easily be commanded by them to do whatever they want "Come hither; stand here; sit here; eat this." Therefore He is विधेयात्मा .

## 628 सत्कीर्तिः
He of true renown. He is Sath कीर्ति , because He has a great and pure reputation for being so amiable and affable by nature. It would be quite correct to make a statement as follows with reference to His nature. 'Whatever is said of भगवान् in His praise does exist in Him. But it does not mean that all that exists in Him is only that much and not more; or more has been said than what actually exists in Him.' Vide : "कृष्ण is described by all wise men as the Supreme Lord of all lords in the world. But what they have said is only a small part of His greatness. How can it be called as praise or hyperbole when one states what actually exists in Him?". "O हृषीकेश ! (The Lord of all इन्द्रिय-s, श्री कृष्ण !) It is quite appropriate that the world is delighted by Thy fame, and becomes drawn towards Thee".

## 629 छिन्नसंशयः
The Dispeller of all doubts; As He has the great reputation of being endowed with qualities like amiability and affability, all doubts about Him stand dispelleddoubts, if He can be easily known or is difficult to be known, if He can be easily pleased or is difficult to be pleased, and if He is easily accessible or difficult to approach. Thus He is Chinna samsaya. "(Worship) Him who bestows clearness to the mind of the soul." "There is no one else who can clear this doubt (from my mind)' (says Arjuna to कृष्ण .)

## 630 उदीर्णः
He who is clearly manifest. How (does He clear the doubts)? He has a pleasing and splendid form which is the object of direct perception to the eyes of persons. So He is उदीर्णः

## 631 सर्वतश्चक्षुः
He who is visible to the eyes of all. He is सर्वतs-चक्षुः , because the eyes of even ordinary people like ourselves can perceive Him (when He incarnates Himself as राम and कृष्ण or as idols in temples or in our houses.) Therefore, it is certain that all doubts about Him are dispelled. Surely there cannot be any doubt about an object that is directly and clearly seen.

## 632 अनीशः
He who is not the Master With reference to those who are exclusively devoted to Him, He does not asset His rulership. He is completely in the hands of His devotees in regard to all things that pertain to Him, like bathing, decoration, association with others etc. So He is अनीशः .

## 633 शाश्वत-स्स्थिरः
He Who is eternally existent. He assumes the various forms of the images which continue to exist for ever and which are directly perceptible to the eyes, at all times. Vide the शातवात संहित l : "He assumes a form similar to that of the image (fashioned by us), enters into it and remains there."

## 634 भूशयः
He who lies on the ground. When His devotees pray to Him and invoke only His presence in this World. He comes and continues to remain in places chosen and indicated by them which go by the names of Svayam-vyaktha, Siddha, मानुष etc. He takes a pleasure even in lying down in those places in order to bless them. So He is भूसयः . (Swayam-vyakthaPlaces where the Lord has chosen to manifest Himself. Siddha are places where the Images of the Lord have been consecrated and installed by Siddhas or perfected beings. मानुष are places where the Lord is installed by ordinary human beings).

## 635 भूषणः
He Who becomes adorned. By this good disposition of His which is beneficial to all He, the Consort of लक्षमी , becomes adorned भूषण . It does not bring discredit to the affluent if they visit the houses of those who are destitute as their guest, partake of the food they eat, and share their joys and sorrows along with them. On the contrary, it only sets off their greatness and adorns them as an ornament. "The affix 'yuch' is employed after the verbs having the sense of 'krudh' (to be angry), 'mand' (to adorn) etc.

## 636 भूतिः
He Who is wealth. He is भूतिः , really the all-round wealth for those who are devoid of all other means, external and internal. That is to say, He is their wealth in every waylike loving sons, milk-yielding cows and kind-hearted friends.

## 637 भूतिः
He who is wealth. He is भीति i, really the all-round wealth for those who are devoid of all other means, external and internal. That is to say, He is their wealth in every waylike loving sons, milk-yielding cows and kind-hearted friends.

## 638 अशोकः
He who is without sorrow. There is no reason for Him to feel sorrowful since He never abandons any one who is destitute. There is no reason for Him to feel sorrowful since He never abandons any one who is a destitute. 'विशोकः ' is another reading and the meaning is the same.

## 639 शोकनाशनः
The sorrow distroyer. He destroys the sorrow of the people resulting from the loss of contact with Him. The Sorrow of the people resulting from the loss of contact with Him. "I have heard from great men like you that He who has realised the आतमन् crosses the ocean of sorrow. O Sir! I am sorrowful. I request you to be pleased to help me cross this ocean of sorrow." "They are in grief who know how difficult it is to have a vision of God Who is their greatest relative". . अर्चिष्मान् He who has great lustre. Though, His greatness is a secret (to others). He has a celestial splendour that opens the eyes, both external and internal, of His devotees. He is अर्चिष्मान् .

## 640 अर्चितः
He who is worshipped. व्यास next proceeds to state that all that has been stated above with reference to superior qualities of भगवान् is quite possible and stands to reason. He is Archithah. Archa is the incarnation of भगवान् in images and Architha signifies He has that form. This incarnation of भगवान् in images or icons is not in a far off place like the पर-रूप , (the Transcendental form of भगवान् ). Nor is it limited to a particular place or time like His incanations as a god (उपेन्द्र for example) or a human being (as राम ), all of which are known as विभवा-अवतार . But it is perceptible in holy places, temples and houses at all times. The mysterious truth about it can be learnt from the Bhagavath शास्त्रा-s (also known as पञ्चरात्र आगमा-s), बोधायन Smruthi, वैष्णव पुराण and other scriptural Texts. Vide : in वैष्णव धर्म "After having shapped a beautiful image of विष्णु with a lovely face and lovely eyes out of gold silver and the like in a manner that would be pleasing, one should worship it, do sacrifice to it and mediatate on it. By doing so one would enter into that form which is none other than Brahman itself and will have all one's sins dispelled."

## 641 कुम्भः
He who is an object of desire. He is desired by all (Kumbhah) because of His beauty which is similar to the beauty with which they are familiar in this world. "The substitute 'kum' comes in the place of the root 'kamu' (to desire) and the affix 'bha' is also added. Kamu+kum (kamu=kum+bha=kumbha). Or भगवान् is called Kumbha because He shines (भा ) in this world (kum). By His immense power He drives away all fear from the servants of Yama and the like; The Lord shines in this worldKumbha, the world which is marked by he presence of only shrines and temples, where the utmost that can be done by a person is only meditation and worship and the contact for a human being with which is limited by birth and death. The word 'kumbha' is treated as correct and comes under the 'प्रिषोदरादि ' rule. The boundary, the extent and the like of the holy shrines have been described in the पौष्कर -भाग as follows : "A holy shrine sanctifies that part of the earth around it even as it does its own place. Such is the greatness of the shrine." "The sanctity of a holy shrine extends up to that part of the land where the echo of the sound of the conch blown from the temple of a god is heard". "The embodied souls who wish to attain the fruits in this world and the other, and who strive to attain them, 'the fruits in the form of the eight Siddhis like अणिम , attain them if they live in the sacred shrines." "The Lord is present in all places in the highways and by ways so that all beings who live on this earth may attain salvation (if by chance they happen to tread on those paths)." "When a man, living in a holy shrine, gives up his life praying to God in the last moments 'O Lord जनार्दन ; Save me' and lies surrounded by his wife and children, the attendants of the Lord of that holy shrine at once come there and first drive away by force the frightening servants of the Lord of death (Yama). Then with the blowing of conchs and beating of drums, they mount the body on a splendid chariot and take it to the presence of the Lord and submit. 'O Lord! In this holy shrine of Thine this person has given up his mortal body composed of the five elements. Now he is a destitute. Please do according to his desert. Then the Lord on hearing the words of his attendants, turns His eyes full of mercy on that person to bless him." As stated above, in the case of those who have given up their bodies in a holy shrine, the Lord of the shrine, Himself purifies them or through His servants. According to their Karma they attain god even in that birth itself or after a series of virtuous births. This is the teaching of the Scriptures.

## 642 विशुद्धात्मा
He of a pure natur. In this way भगवान् sacrifices all that He has on the devotees who have resorted to Him. He is called विशुद्धात्मा .

## 643 विशोधनः
The Purifier. He purifes those who give up their body in a holy shrine and who are fit to attain Him.

## 644 अनिरुद्धः

## 645 अप्रतिरथः
The matchless. His name is जनार्दन , which means the Tormentor of the people. In accordance with that name. When He begins to torment those who are wicked by nature, no one can prevent Him. So He is अप्रतिरथः .

## 646 प्रद्युम्नः
The Illuminator He is Pradyumna since He makes the individual souls effulgent. "The Illuminator" -- say the Maulas. "Pradyumna is Purushothtama, the Supreme पुरुष ." "Presiding over all things, He Himself resides here and bestows the supreme goal to His devotees."

## 647 अमितविक्रमः
He of immesurable steps. In His Incarnation as Thrivikrams, all the three worlds were no match for His three steps. So He is Thrivikrama. "O Brahma, the Lotus-born! The God of gods, Thrivikrama, has stationed Himself in the waters of the यमुना , and bestows the supreme goal to all men."

## 648 कालनेमिनिहा
The destroyer of the wheel of ignorance of Time The destroyer of the wheel of ignorance of Time. Paramँthma lives in these places and removes the blemiढes of Kali-yuga. So He is कालनेमिनिहा . "Avidya (ignorance), by name, is an irresistible felly of the wheel of Time; when it comes to me, it loses its form." "One should meditate on the Lord as the Destroyer of the spread of ignorance." This is how the meditation on the Lord कालनेमिनिहा has been laid down.

## 649 शौरिः
The son of soora. ie Vasudeva "With the name of Sauri the Lord lives in the country उत्पलावर्तक , by name." Therefore His name is Sauri. He is called Sauri, because He is the son of Su:ra (which is another name for वासुदेव ).

## 650 शूरः
The valiant. शूरः is राम as stated in the following text: "The great राम , Who has broad lotus-like eyes and Who brought about the destruction of the राक्षसा-s, lives on the चित्रकूट Mountain." The word 'Su:ra' is derived form the root 'su' (to go). "The affix 'kran' comes after the roots 'su', 'si', 'chi' and 'mi." and the root of the vowel is lengthened." (Su+ra=su:ra).

Both of us have been born out of Thy body and therefore Thou art known by the name of केशव ." (words of Siva to भगवान् .)"

## 655 केशिहा

## 661 कृतागमः
The propounder of the Agamas. He reveals to the pure-minded the Scriptural texts containing different kinds of मन्त्रा-s.

## 662 अनिर्देश्यवपुः

In the Adithya-पुराणा it is said: "Since the entire Universe is pervaded by the Supreme Deity, He is known as विष्णु . The name ' विष्णु ' is derived from the root 'vis' (to enter into)." In the उद्योग (parva in महाभारत )- "The Lord gets the name ' विष्णु ', because He measured the three worlds with His steps."

## 664 वीरः

## 665 अनन्तः

"There is no end to a description in detail of the objects (which I control)." "There is no end to this object known as Brahman." "Brahman is Existence, Knowledge and infinite." All these signify that it is the nature of भगावन् to act at all times, in all places and in all ways. The fact of His not baing conditioned by objects does not mean that there is complete identity between the object and Himself, For then it will lead to the unwelcome conclusion that space and time also will become identical with Him and that they have no separate existence. It is not to you liking.

## 666 धनंजयः
He who surpasses wealth That He is boundless is established with reference to His qualities and possessions. Dhananjaya-He excels all wealth like gold diamond ect., because of His great superiority. He is longed for eagerly by all. All make great efforts to acquire Him, and keep Him secure. Above all He is the means for their redemption.

## 667 ब्रह्मण्यः
He who is beneficial to brahman. He Who is beneficial to Brahman (i.e. the sentient beings and the non-sentient objects). Here the word 'Brahman' is used to signify things that are big. In several place जावात्मा also is referred to as Brahman, because his acts are great and his knowledge is profound. His enjoyment of all objects in this world and in the other is also great. "That (individual soul) whose essential nature is knowledge, is called Brahman." "The Brahman (the individual soul) when unsullied (i.e. free from contact with the Prakruthi) is the same everywhere." The Avyaktha (or Prakruthi) is also called Brahman (big)., When it is enjoyed by the individual soul, it transforms itself into infinite objects of enjoyment. Vide "The womb (from which the Universe is born) is the great Brahman (i.e. prakruthi). It also belongs to Me." Since भगवान् is the cause for the existence and enjoyment of these two (prakruthi and पुरुष ), He is benificial to them. Hence His name ब्राह्मण्या .

## 668 ब्रह्मकृद्ब्रह्मा
He who controls Brahma, the creator of big things He Who controls Brahma, the creator of big things. Mahath, अहन्कार and other things which are the effects of prakruthi, are also big: because they expand themselves as big things in the world. So they also are called Brahman (big). Vide "From Him (the Supreme Brahman) proceeds this undifferentiated creation (Brahman) as also the world of matter and soul (anna) characterised by the distinguishing marks of name and form." This world is brahma (big): the four-faced Brahma is the creator of this world (brahma-kruth); this Brahma is always controlled by परमात्मा , Whose name therefore is Bramha-kruth-Brahma.

## 669 ब्रह्म
The Supreme Brahman, Paramatma. Thus परमात्म expands the non-sentient matter as gross and subtle, and expands the souls as aggregate and separate. He also is big with the hosts of unsurpassed and auspicious qualities, and big by His essential nature and by the glory of His possessions. Therefore He is Brahman, He does not look for any external help to do anything and is to be learnt only from a study of the Upanishads. "He is called Brahman, because He is Himself big and He makes others also big." "The affix 'मणिन्' comes after the root 'brmh' (to increase) and the nasal is replaced by 'a'."

## 670 ब्रह्मविवर्धनः
He who makes the Dharma grow. He who makes the Dharma grow. The word 'Brahma' here signifies 'Thapas' which includes in itself Dharma. Dharma is the cause of all this, and that Dharma also is Brahman. He makes that Dharma also grow. So He is Bramha-vivardhanah. "Thapo Brahma" is the Sruthi text.

## 671 ब्रह्मवित्
The knower of the Vedas. The वेदास् that reveal Him are called Brahma. A वेदिc text reads: "We (the students) are going to study Brahma, (i.e.the Vedँs)." "भगवान् are indeed endless." भगवान् knows the ultimate limit of those वादास् also. So He is Brahma vith. Vide "Brahma (i.e. the Veda) is both beginningless and endless. Neither the gods, nor the sages know that वेदा . That one great Creator भगवान् नारायण alone knows it by Himself."

## 672 ब्राह्मणः
The Instructor of the Vedas. परमात्मा is called ब्राह्ममण, because he takes birth in the Athri-gओthra and others as a Brahmin in the form of दत्तात्रेय and others in order to establish the teachings of the वेदाs in this world. Or according to the Ethymologists, ब्राह्ममण is one who guides or recites the वेद ."

## 673 ब्रह्मी
He who has Brahma as His possession. All these things in the form of प्रमेय and प्रमाण known as Brahma, are His possessions. (प्रमाण is the वेद the means of knowledge and प्रमेय is the objects of knowledge viz. Prakruthi, पुरुष ,ईश्वर (etc.) "Hari is the embodiment of all these things which go by the name of Brahma."

## 674 ब्रह्मज्ञ
The knower of the Vedas. He cognises directly the वेदा-s and their meanings as well. So he is Brahma-jnah. "I alone am the knower of the वेदा-s."

## 675 ब्राह्मणप्रियः
He who has the Brahmins as His favourites. He Who has the Brahmins as His favourites. Vide "Though the Brahmin beats a person, curses him, utters harढ words to him, he who does not bow to him (the Brahmin) unlike Me Who bowed (to Bhrugu)-(he is a sinner). He will be consumed by the wild fire of the Brahmin's anger. He deserves to be killed and punished. He is not Mine." "But those devotees who adopt this nectar of virtuous conduct as taught above (i.e. follow the Karma योग ), who are full of faith, and who hold Me as the Highest Deity, they are exceedingly dear to Me.)" "I vanquish the असुरा-s only by the favour of the Brahmins," "How much more easily then the Brahmins (and the royal sages) will reach the supreme goal (who are of meritorious births and who are my devotees)!" The unlimited nature of भगवान् in diverse ways has been revealed by the following scriptural texts: "( भगवान् ) is greater than the great." "Higher than the high and greater than the great." "He is far greater than the great." And so on.

## 676 महाक्रमः
He who provdes steps for the elevation of others. Next the unlimited nature of His affection towards those, in whom an eagerness to attain Him has been created, is going to be dealt with. महाकर्मः - He who provides steps for the elevation of others. परमात्मा is very high and the जीवा-s are far below in the Nether-world of Samsara. In order to raise them up, He provides a gradually ascending series of great steps. So He is called महाकर्मः . This is like the action of the mother who first feeds the infant with her breast-milk, then with cow's milk and then gives the child solid food and finally luxurious food. Similarly in order to redeem a virtuous person, भगवान् raises him step by step and makes him act up to His will. At first he removes from his mind the hatred against Him; then He makes him believe Him and His injunctions; next He draws the mind of man towards him.

## 677 महाकर्मा
He of great actions. Extremely surprising and great are His acts. He makes a creature which, in its birth as a worm of germ, is so small like a drop of the leavings left by a person, become endowed with the enjoyment of His great glory.

He of great Resplendence. He has an effulgence which destroys the darkness of the beginningless ignorance of those who are तमसिक् by nature.

## 679 महोरगः
He who is great and enters into the heart. How can He who is so very great come near these beings which are small like a particle of dust? Like the material objects of pleasure, He also gets into them through their external sense organs and then enters into their heart. Here the word 'uras' which means chest signifies the heart. Thus he reaches them through their hearts.

## 680 महाक्रतुः
The great God who has the easiest means of worship. "Who will not endeavour to please that God Who cannot be pleased by wealth or riches, and clothes or ornaments, but Who will be pleased by the sincere heart ?" As stated in the text there is a grand, but easy way of worढipping Him. So He is महाक्रतुः . He is to be worshipped by all acts which have been prescribed by the आगम शास्त्र (i.e.पञ्चतन्त्र शास्त्रा-s). All things become sanctified and sweet by being offered to भगवान्. ((श्री कृष्ण says in the गीता )- "Whatever you do, (whatever you eat, whatever is offered in fire, whatever you give by way of charity, and whatever penance you do, O Arjuna, make all that as an offering to Me.)"

## 681 र्महायज्वा
He with worshippers of a superior nature. He is र्महायज्वा , because He has worshippers who are far superior to these who are worshipping others. Vide- "Amongst the hosts of worshippers (in this world), those who are exclusively devoted to Him are the best. They never worship other gods."

## 682 महायज्ञः
He whose worship is the greatest. The sacrifice with its eight accessories like respectful approach, offering of sweet things, mixture of honey etc., Is superior to all other kinds of sacrifices. So He is महा यज्ञ. Vide "Among all धर्मा-s, that Dharma which comprises the adoration of विष्णु is the highest, for He protects His devotees as if they were His own body," "The rites performed by wise men who have supreme and exclusive devotion to भगवान् are received by Him with great joy with His head." "How wonderful I भगवान् pleases all those who have exclusive devotion to Him. He receives with His own head the worship which they do in accordance with the injunctions of the शास्त्रा-s."

## 683 महाहविः
He who is worshipped with supreme oblations. "There was no killing of any animal." "There were only recitations of the Hymns sung in the अरण्यक portion of the वेदा-s." (अरण्यक is a class of religious and philosophical writings (connected with the ब्राह्मणा-s) which are either composed in a forest or must be studied there.) In this way the offerings to Him involve no cruelty to animals. They are सात्विक and are based on the Upanishads. Vide- "The oblation of the Brahman which has the Brahman for its instrument (is offered into the fire of the Brahman by the ब्राह्मण (jivathma.) By him who meditates on the Brahman as (the soul of) work, Brahman alone is to be attained.)" "(And others) offering in addition the sacrifice of knowledge (worship Me as one-(Me), who, marked by diversity in various ways, am multiform)." "Being what I am, I worढip Him and do not go against Him whose property I am." "I make this sacrifice of myself to the Supreme in the effulgent Sun who is the cause of my attaining release (from samsara)." "I myself offer my own self in the fire." Or it may be taken that all these texts refer to the submission of the pure soul (आतमा ) as an offering in a sacrifice. "It was felt by Uparicharvasu, an exclusive and singleminded devotee that his soul, kingdom, wealth wife and vehicles were all for भगवान् ." This fact is revealed by this text also "The sacrifice of knowledge is superior, O slayer of foes, to the sacrifice of material objects."

## 684 स्तव्यः
He who is worthy of praise. The affix 'yath' is added to the root 'sthu' (to praise) in the sense of 'he deserves praise.' भगवान् alone deserves praise since, He is endowed with highly auspicious qualities which are eternal boundless and flawless. He alone is renowned as the Lord of the Thousand Names and His praise alone is not vain flattery. Other gods etc. are not fit to be praised as their qualities are quite contrary to the above. In the बार्हस्पत्य स्मृति it is stated: "A person praises a rich man with great fervour on account of a desire for money. Who will not be released from bondage if he praises the Creator of the Universe in that way?" "These are the thousand names of the reputed Lord Who deserves to be praised with them."

## 685 स्तवप्रियः
He who relishes praise. He is Sthava priya since, He is pleased with anything that is said with the idea of extolling His qualities. It may be done by any person in whatever way and whatever language. It may glorify Him or ever denigrate Him. The story of घण्टाकर्ण is a striking example for this quality of the Lord. (घण्टाकर्ण -He was one of the attendants of Siva and was such a great devotee that he did not like to hear the names of विष्णु and other gods, even spoken casually by others. Lest they should fall in his ears, he suspended two bells from his ears and whenever a person began to speak of विष्णु , he would shake his head violently so that the ringing of the bells would deafen him. In his eagerness to avoid hearing he was keenly observing if any one spoke that name and this, in fact, ended only in his thinking of that god always, though without devotion. It is said that this constant thinking of विष्णु earned for him salvation.

## 686 स्तोत्रं
The Eulogy incarnate. The praise of him is accomplished by himself as an instrument when He is pleased with the singer. This praise of Him is accomplished by Himself as an instrument when He is pleased with the singer. This is seen in the praise of भगवान् by Dhruva. (The young child Dhruva was doing severe penance in order to realise the Lord. When the Lord appeared before him, the child was struck dumb with emotion and could not utter a word. The Lord with love touched the cheek of the child with His conch. The next moment words of praise began to flow from ध्रुवा 's mouth.) "The affix 'ष्ट्रन् ' comes with the sense of the instrument after the roots 'दाम् ', 'ni', 'yu', 'yuj', 'sthu', 'thuda', 'si', 'sicha', 'miha', 'patha', 'dasa' and nah'."

## 687 स्तुतः
He who is praised. He is Sthutha-He is being praised for the attainment of their respective desires by the innumerable Free Angets (नित्य-शूरीs) like the Thousand-hooded आदिशेष . Garuda who is the embodiment of the three-fold वेदाs, by Brahma and other gods in this world and also by human beings like ourselves-by one and all without any distinction. Vide "Whose exploits which are wonderful and beneficial are always extolled by all the chief gods (in the Heaven), and the kings of all kings on earth." "At first Brahma the creator praised Him, then Indra of great knowledge extolled Him, and then the four directions." Here the phrase 'four directions' indicates that He is the object of praise by all beings like ourselves.

## 688 स्तोता
He who praises those who extol Him. It is the nature of परमात्म to praise those that praise Him. Vide. "He who praises भगवान् is praised by भगवान् Himself, and he who adores भगवान् becomes an object of adoration for Him." This can be seen in the episode of the Journey to Kailasa.

## 689 रणप्रियः
The lover of fight. His celestial and lovable exploits are eulogised in the Scriptures like श्रीमद् रामायण ,महाभारत etc. fighting and other such acts of His are done for pleasing His friends. रणप्रिय , Vide "श्री राम killed रावण in the fight and being happy, fulfilled the desires of the powerful सुग्रीव and अंगद ."

## 690 पूर्णः
He who is ful. It is easy to please Him by words of praise alone even without any expense, great physical strain, or elaborate worship. Why? Because he is पूर्णः -full by Himself. He has all His desires realised (and nothing to be longed for).

## 691 पूरयिता
The fulfiller of desires of others. If He is Himself full, then why does He expect the praise etc. as though He is in want of something? It is only to satisfy the desire of others to praise Him that He allows them to do it. So He is पूरयिता , the Fulfiller of their desires.

## 692 पुण्यः
The Purifier. He purifies even the worst sinners and thus makes them fit for extolling Him. He is पुण्यः . "The affix 'yath' comes after the root 'pu:' (to purify), and also the augment 'nuk'. The lng vowel 'u:' of 'pu:' is shortened."

## 693 पुण्यकीर्तिः
He, the singing of whose glory also is purifying. "Maithreya ! Just as fire purifies the metals, the unequalled recitation of the names of भगवान् which have unsurpassed greatness destroys all the sins of men." "They who, without being aware of it, pronounce the name of भगवान् , are freed from all sins in the same way as a deer is freed ffrom the attacks of the beasts of prey which (beasts) become frightened on hearing a lion's roar (and run away leaving the deer)." "A man in Kali Yuga attains by the mere mention of the names of भगवान् everything-whatever fruit a man obtained in Krutha yuga by renunciation (त्याग ), whatever fruit a man obtained in the द्वापर yuga by the performance of sacrifices and whatever fruit a man obtained in the त्रेता युग by worshipping the Lord." It is because of this greatness that it is revealed by the वेद itself that the Hymns in His praise (and those who sing them) purify rows of persons who come into contact with them. (पंक्ति-पावन -An eminent person, especially a respectable ब्राह्मण , who being very learned, always gets the seat of honour at dinner parties or who purifies by his presence the pankthi or persons who sit in the same row to dine with him.)

## 694 अनामयः
The bestower of health. A mere touch of His is like a celestial medicine (अनामयः ). He is an adversary to the great disease viz, संसार . Since, संसार is an obstacle to the power of enjoying the glory of भगवान् , it is called a disease. Those who have realised its true nature have said, "I am full of disease."

## 695 मनोजवः
He who is swift as thought. He is so quick in doing things stated above that he has got the name मनोजवः swift as though. श्री कृष्ण Himself has sung in the गीता "(By My Grace) soon he becomes one whose mind is devoted to dharma (of worship) (and attains enduring peace)." "The sins committed in seven births, be they many or a few, all are destroyed the moment a man begins to place his foot in the temple of विष्णु ."

## 696 तीर्थकरः
The source for the holiness. He is the source for the sacredness of the Ganga, पुष्कर (lake) and others which like Himself, purify all those that meditate on them and recite their names. Or He is तीर्थकरः because He is the founder of the good doctrines of the Sruthis and Smrithंs. Vide "योग , knowledge, संख्य (Science, craft and other arts, वेदा-s, शास्त्रा and music- all have the origin in जनार्दन )." Or He, Who is like a deep and unreachable ocean, makes a series of incarnations which are like steps with the help of which devotees are able to reach Him.

## 697 वसुरेता
The source of Lustre. Here begins the Incarnation as कृष्ण. He is वसु-रेताः the cause of the divine lustre. 'Vasu' means lustre. "O great sage! He took out the hairs, white and black." "They are known as केश of Mine." The word 'केश ' has already been explained.

## 698 वसुप्रदः
The treasure -giver He gives His own self, which is like a supreme treasure, to देवकी and वासुदेव as their son.

## 699 वसुप्रदः
The dignity - giver. He is the Father of the Universe; still He bestows on देवकी and वासुदाव the supreme glory of being the parents of Himself Who is the Universal Father. So again He is वसु- प्रदः .

The son of Vasudeva. He is वासुदाव also because of His being the son of वासुदाव .

## 701 वसुः
The Dweller. The Lord Who has His abode in the Milk-ocean and from whom all the incarnations proceed is mentioned by the name Vasu Vide "The great Lord resides in the Milk-ocean for doing good to the people of the world." "This नारायण is always with लक्षमी, नारायण , Whose abode is the Milk-ocean. He has come to the city of मधुर leaving His serpent-couch (आदिशेष )." And so on.

## 702 वसुमना
He whose mind is with Vasudeva. Even though He is residing in the Milk-ocean, the birth place of लक्षमी , His mind is always with Vasu (viz. वासुदेव ). (वसुमनाः ), Scholars in महाभाष्य say that the word 'Vasu' denotes वासुदेव even as the word 'दत्त ' is used to denote 'देवदत्त '. And भाम ' to denote 'सत्य भाम '.

## 703 हविः
He who was handed over. Even though कृष्ण had a desire to be with देवकी and वासुदेव , they entrusted Him to नन्दगोप and यशोद for protection from कंस . Their affection for Him was so great that even without any reason they were apprehensive that Kamsa might do Him harm.

## 704 सद्गतिः

## 705 सत्कृतिः

Even the innocent acts of His infacy and childhood were lovable since, they cut the fetters of the entire material world-acts like stealing the curd and butter, being tied to the mortar crawling on the knees, रास क्रीड (dance with the गोपी-s) etc. Vide "My birth and acts are all supernatural"

## 706 सत्ता

## 708 सत्परायणः
The Support for the good. "पाण्डवा-s have कृष्णा as their resort, कृष्णा as their strength, and कृष्णा as their saviour. In short, कृष्णा is their great support." So, He is Sath परायण . He Himself said so "You will certainly attain Me." If 'सत्-परायणम् ' is the reading , then the word is in the Neuter gender. If 'सत्-परायणः is the reading. then the word will be in the masculine gender and it should be interpreted as follows: the good people themselves are the highest resort for Him. Vide "The पाण्डवा-s are verily My life-breath." "Thou art they Protector of the पाण्डवा-s and we have taken resort to Thee." "But it is My view that the wise men are My inner soul."

## 709 शूरसेनः
He with a valiant army. The यादवा-s and the पाण्डवाs were of great help to कृष्ण when He relieved the Earth of her burden. "All the beings live in Thee and therefore Thou art their abode, O Hari."

"All the beings live in Thee and therefore Thou art their abode, O Hari."

## 714 वासुदेवः
The Deity that presides over the tweleve-lettered (Vasideva) Mantra. When He is the son of वासुदेवः , He keeps within Himself His nature as the Supreme Deity that presides over the double six-lettered Manthra, So He is वासुदेवः. It is because of this, that that वासुदेवः Who is in the aspect of Wakeful Emanation is particularised as the Deity Incarnate in Matthura. Vide "Unto Him Who is connected with Matthura and Whose acts are all fascinating and wonderful."

## 715 सर्वासुनिलयः

Or He cannot put up with the offence committed against His devotees. So does He declare "At this time of destruction two persons will not all be forgiven by Me. I will kill Him who obstructs the conduct of a sacrifice and also him who is ill-disposed towards the पाण्डवा-s."

## 717 दर्पहा

In सभा पर्वम् "(Even though he did so many great things) like these, He never became proud on account of His majestic nature." Or the reading may be 'Druptha' which means proud. He took pride in being fondled with love by यशोद and नन्दगोप .

## 720 दुर्धरः
The Uncontrollable. Even in the sportive activities in His childhood, He, like an elephant in ruts, could not be controlled by them both. (Durdhara). His actions were naughty and uncontrollable. As यशोद said. "O Thou of naughty acts! Now run away if Thou canst."- Or He was unassailable to the evil-hearted. "These men of little knowledge want to seize and bind Him just as a boy or weak girls think of keeping under control the blazing fire with a piece of cloth." "The wind cannot be caught by the hand, nor the earth by the head (of a man). Similarly केशव cannot be caught by force."

## 721 अपराजितः
The Invincible. Again in the भरत युद्ध , all the five पाण्डवा-s were without any supporters. They were not defeated by the hundred sons of धृतराष्ट्र who were very strong with great armies, because they were supported by श्री कृष्ण , the invincible (अपराजित ). In the अरण्य पर्व , indra says to कर्ण : "In the great fight, you can kill one thundering warrior, but not that one, (Arjuna) who is protected by the great God (श्री कृष्ण)." "कृष्ण , Whom the Vedic scholars declare as the Invincible Hari, Who had assumed the form of Wild Boar (वराह ) and Who is the Incomparable नारायण ." The "Words of rudra to Jayadratha are :-- "In the fight you can ward off the attacks of all invincible and indestructible warriors except that long-armed Arjuna who is unassailable even to the gods." "That great Arjuna, who is protected by कृष्ण कृष्ण Who is the Unknowable Deity and Who bears the conch, discus and mace (as arms)." "The best of men! Victory is quite assured for him whose charioreer Thou hast agreed to be. There is no defeat for him." भीष्म , द्रोण and others also say in one voice : "With this one bow I can annihilate all the पाण्डवाs if विष्णु is not their Protector विष्णु Who is the Supreme पुरुष and Who is the Cause of the Universe. "Truth is steady in a Brahmin; humility is certain in the pious; wealth is sure in the skilful; Victory is certain in नारायण ." "He is invincible, eternal and steady." "He is unconquered and is the wielder of the sword," "Where कृष्ण is, there victory is certain." "Where कृष्ण, the Lord of the योगा-s is, (where पार्था , the bow-armed Arjuna is, there is prosperity, there is victory, there is welath and there is firm justicethis is my conclusion)." In the आयुर्वेद चक्र - (संहित ), मन्त्र to be chanted while pounding the medicine is : "I do not know defeat in वासुदेव ; I do not know the marriage of my mother; I do not know the complete drying of the waters of the ocean. This its true. On the varacity of this statement, may this medicine be pounded and be effective." In वैतरण , speaking about the poison-removing Manthra, it is said; "(Let this be effective) imperturbable like the ocean, steady like the हिमवान् , unapproachable like the fire, and unconquerable like नारायण ."

## 722 विश्वमूर्तिः
He who has the Universe as His body. How is it that the strong cannot conquer the weak? This is because the whole world is His body. It is well-known that no one will do anything which is harmful to himself. With this idea in mind, the poet says; विश्वमूर्तिः '. Vide "O गुदाकेश (Arjuna)' I am the inner Soul Who resides in the hearts of all beings." (गदक means lethargy and isa means the conqueror. गुदाकेश is one of the names of Arjuna signifying that he has overcome lethargy).

## 723 महामूर्तिः
He of immense form. He is Mahaa-moorthih since His body is the resort for the entire Universe. He is महा-मूर्तिः since His body is the resort for the entire Universe. Vide "गुदाकेश See now the whole Universe with all things, moving and non-moving, in one corner of my body and you may also see whatever else you wish to see."

## 724 दीप्तमूर्तिः
He with shining form. Any object shining with its qualities owes this characteristic to Him because of its being His body. So He is दीप्तमूर्तिः . Vide : "Whatever being is possessed of lordly power or splendour or is energetic in noble endeavours (know that it has sprung from a fraction of my power)." And so on.

## 725 अमूर्तिमान्
He who is the master of even subtile things. All things subtle and formless like Avyaktha (Prakruthi), individual souls etc., they also are His possessions. So He is अमूर्तिमान् . Vide : "Earth, Water, Fire, Wind &.. (all these are Mine)." "This is My Prakruthi, which is lower. There is another Prakruthi which is higher than this. (Know that it also belongs to Me)." "Whose body the Avyaktha (the Unmanifested Prakruthi) is". "Whose body the individual soul is." This name अमूर्तिमान् should not be taken to signify the negation of a form for भगवान् , since it will be contrary to the statement found earlier and later, that He has forms. Again the use of the affix 'mathup' (signifying possession of something) in the word 'अमूर्तिमान् ' will become meaningless if the forms as such are negated.

## 726 अनेकमूर्तिः
He of many forms. He is अनेकमूर्तिः He of many forms. He is अनेकमूर्तिः since, He has many forms which are peculiar to Him. Even when He is as कृष्ण , He has not given up His four (व्यूह ) forms वासुदेव etc. Again it is said : "In order to be always in the company of His 16100 Queens, Lord Srं कृष्ण , the Son of देवकी , took as many forms."

## 727 अव्यक्तः
He who is not manifest. Having assumed the form of an ordinary human being. He conceals His true nature. "To all I am not manifest (as the Supreme Deity)." "Neither through the वेदा-s, nor through austerities (Is it possible for any one to see Me as you have done, O Arjuna!)

## 728 शतमूर्तिः
He with a hundre forms. श्री कृष्ण assumed a cosmic form for the sake of Arjuna who wanted to see Him in full. "O Arjuna! Look at My bodies which are in hundreds and thousands."

## 729 शताननः
The hundred faced. In the same context Arjuna himself says : "Having many mouths and eyes, (many wonderful aspects, many divine ornaments and many divine weapons held erect)."

## 730 एकः
The Unique. He is एकः , unique and matchless since, with reference to His supreme greatness, there is no one who can be equated with Him. Statements like 'two Brahmins' three क्षत्रिया-s etc. are current because there are many who can be classified under the same head as Brahmins or क्षत्रिया-s . In regard to भगवान् there is no one equal to Him possessing such special characteristics. So He is एक , the One Who is unique. Vide : "He is the King of the whole world.:" "There is no one like Him." "एक " is derived from the root 'I' (to go). The affix 'क्ष' is added to the roots 'I' (to (go), 'bhi' (to fear 'kai') to (to sound (etc.) ('Ih'=एकः ; kai=काकः ).

## 731 नैकः
He who is not one only. This Oneness is not based upon the negation of all things, or on illusion, or by intermixture or modifications etc. He has all things which are His glorious possessions and which are of a nature different from His. Therefore He is not One. Vide : "O Arjuna, the destroyer of enemies! There is no end to the divine glories of Mine. (What I have stated in detail is only a part of My glories.)"

## 732 सः
The Generator. Beginning from His childhood. He spreads knowledge about Him which is well known to all. So He is 'Sah' The word 'Sah' is derived from the verb 'syathi' (spreads or generates). The affix 'da' comes after the roots 'sam' 'muढi', and 'syathi' (to spread)".

## 733 वः
The Dweller. In accordance with his reputation, He dwells in all. In accordance with His reputation, He dwells in all. So He is Vah'. "The affix 'da' comes after the root 'वसति ' (dwells)." "All being dwell in Him Who is Himself all beings and the Inner Soul of all. He also dwells in all of them without exception. Therefore, O sage, He is signified by the letter "va".

## 734 कः
He who shines. Though He dwells in things that are dirty, still He is resplendent.. "The affix 'da' has been added to the verb 'कानती ' (shines).

## 735 किं
What ? He is to be enquired into by all without any motive who are desirous of knowing the objects of their desire. "He is to be sought after; He is to be known with eagerness," 'Kim' is derived from the root 'prachh' (to ask or to be eager to know). "The affix 'im' comes after the roots 'prachh', 'damsi' etc., and the substhitute 'ka' also comes." (prachh+ im-k+im=kim).

## 736 यत्
He who takes efforts. He is yath since, He takes all efforts for their protection. Vide "Whoever remembers Me always repeating the names 'Kriढखa', 'कृष्ण ', 'कृष्ण ', I lift him up from Naraka (hell) just as one takes a lotus by brushing aside the water." "I remember My devotee and take him to the Supreme abode." 'Yath' is derived from the root 'yath' ('to attempt') and the affix 'kvip' has been added.

## 737 तत्
He who increases The nasal of 'gam' and others is always elided before 'kvi' and here 'Kvip'. By this rule the nasal is lost and there is the augment 'thuk' (t). Hence the usage 'thath' in the following: "That superior lustre of the Lord, the cause of the Universe." "The threefold expression 'ॐ Thath Sath' is regarded as (the characterisation) of the Brahman". And so on.

## 738 पदमनुत्तमम्
The supreme goal. He is the Unsurpassed Goal since, it is the great desire of all to attain Him. The word 'Padam' is derived from the verb 'पदयते ' which means 'that which is attained'.

## 739 लोकबन्धुः
The Relative of the World Thus He blesses all without exception. The relationship which is the cause of this quality is spoken of as 'लोक बन्धुः '. "नारायण is the mother, father, brother abode, refuge, friend and the final goal". "I am the father of this Universe." And so on. The word 'bandhu' is derived from the root 'bandh' (to tie). "The affix 'u' comes after the roots 'Sr' 'Svr', 'snih'- 'bandh' etc.

## 740 लोकनाथः
The protector of the world. The unique relationship which is the cause of that attachment and which is natural to Him is next delineated लोकनाथः , Master.

## 741 माधव
The consort of lakshmi. The special relationship of paramathma with all beings is described. The name माधव indicates that His relationship of the world along with श्री (लक्षमी ) is that of a father and mother. Or He is a scion of the Race of the Madhus. Or in another way also; "O भारत Realise माधव by means of the observance of silence (मा), meditation (dha) and योग (va)."

## 742 भक्तवत्सलः
Affectionate towards the devotees. His special attitude towards devotees who, as described above, are eager to cultivate the relationship with Him as Master and kinsman, is described by the name Bhaktha vathsala. His joy of having attained them is so great that He forgets all other desires.

## 743 सुवर्णवर्णो
The Golden-hued. Like the quality of affection mentioned above, He has a celestial hue which is flawless and effulgent like polished gold Vide; When the seer realises Him of golden hue." "He has a form which is respldent like gold and is capable of being seen by the mind (undisturbed) as in a dream." "Him Who has the lustre of the Sun." "(The Supreme person (परमात्म ) is हिरण्य -is beneficent and charming His body is of golden hue."

## 744 हेमाङ्गः
He of golden limbs. The limbs of His body which are eternal, celestial and composed of Saththva गुणा are endowed with a golden hue. "The Supreme Person of golden hue is seen."

## 745 वराङ्ग
He of a magnificient body. This form, which is spoken of in the Upanishads and the celestial marks of which are concealed (from mortal eyes), was manifested as prayed for by देवकि . Vide "आनक दुन्दुभि , i.e. वासुदेव , saw Him Who was born. He had the colour of the petal of a full-blown blue lily. He had four arms and the mole Srं vathsa on His chest. वासुदेव began to praise Him."

## 746 चन्दनाङ्गदी
He who is adorned with delightful armlets. Though the body is not bedecked with jewels (as it is a jewel by itself), pleasing things get themselves attached to it and produce the effect of its being adorned. Or He is चन्दनाङ्गदी since, He has ornaments celestial like bracelets and other of which the armlet is but an example here. The affix 'inin' is added in the sense of abundance.

## 747 वीरहा
The slayer of the strong demons. Even though He was but an innocent infant, He slew the deceitful असुरा-s like पुतन , Sakata, the Twin Arjuna trees and others without leaving any trace behind since they were the enemies of gods.

## 748 विषमः
He of conflicting acts. He is विषम , not uniform since, He acts in different ways with different persons. Towards the devotees He was benevolent, whereas towards the ill-disposed He was terrific.

## 749 शून्यः
He who was devoid of defects. Though He was in the form of a human being, He was absolutely bereft of all defects. The word 'शून्य ' is derived from the root 'शून् ' (to go) The affix 'nyath' has been added to the root.

## 750 घृताशीः
He Who is desirous of making the world prosperous. घृतम् means sprinkling and the word is derived from the root 'घृ ' (to sprinkle). He makes the world prosperous by means of His benevolent qualities; or He has a desire for the butter and ghee in the houses of the cowherds in गोकुल .

## 751 अचलः
The Unshakable. He was unconquerable to the evil-minded दुर्योधन and others.

## 752 चलः
He Who swerves. He is called चलः , because for the sake of helping the पाण्डवा-s who were His devotees, He even swerved from the righteous path of keeping His word. श्री कृष्ण had taken a vow that He would not handle or use any weapon in the भारत-युद्ध् . But in order to save Arjuna from भीष्म He did not mind breaking His vow with the Chakra in the uplifted hand He ruढed towards भीष्म to attack him. Vide- "श्री कृष्ण , the younger brother of महेन्द्र (in one incarnation) seized the Chakra and with a loud war-cry rushed forward against Bhंढma). Seeing the angry कृष्ण all the beings (in the battlefield of कुरुक्षेत्र) cried aloud in distress thinking that the destruction of the कौरवा-s was certain. वासुदेव the Lord of the Universe, jumped down from the chariot with the Chakra in hand and rushed forward as though he was going to annihilate all the army. He shone like the धूमकेतु (the comet) which rises to burn all the beings of the Universe.

## 753 अमानी
He who is not proud. He is अमानी since, He is not self-conceited where His devotees are concerned. That is why He did not feel shy of going as a messenger; but He undertook the errand.

## 754 मानदः
He who honours others. He gave Arjuna the honour of being the master of the chariot and was ready to be his driver; He made उग्रसेन the Sovereign and was his vassel; made युधिष्ठिर the king and respected him.

## 755 मान्याः
The object of honour. He is to be honoured as being affectionate towards His devotees. Indeed, He felt Himself honoured only in that way. "In the battle of कुरुक्षेत्र today when कृष्ण , the charioteer of Arjuna, is angry, no one amongst the सात्वता-s and the कौरवा-s can escape death."

## 756 लोकस्वामी
The master of the Universe. Who was He that acted like this? लोकस्वामी -The Supreme Lord of the Universe.

## 757 त्रिलोकधृत्
He who suports the three worlds. When He is really so exalted how does He come down? Because He is त्रिलोकधृत् . He shoulders the burden of supporing and nourishing the entire Universe. "I stand controlling and regulating all this Universe."

## 758 सुमेधा
The well -intentioned. He is always bent upon thinking about the welfare of His devotees and doing good to them. There is the suffix 'ssich' at the end of this compound word (सुमेधा) under the rule "The affix 'asich' comes invariably after the two words 'praja' I and 'मेहा ."

## 759 मेधजः
He who was born as a result of a sacrifice. Therefore He was born as a result of the 'मेधा' (i.e.sacrifice) in the form of the austeritles practised by देवकी to get Him as son. So He is Medhajah. I deed He spoke to देवकी as follows: "O Revered Lady! You praised Me before desirous of having Me as your son. Your prayers have become fruitful today since I have taken birth out of your womb." "O Auspicious Lady! When you worshipped Me in the proper manner before, I became pleased and made a promise to you (that I would be born as your son). That has been carried out now."

## 760 धन्यः
The Blessed. श्री कृष्ण considered that to be born as the son of देवकी was a great fortune. Now that he had acquired it, He became Dhanya (Blessed). "The affix 'yath' comes in the sense of 'who obtains it' after the words 'dhana' and 'gana' being in the second case in the construction." (Dhana+ya=Dhanya).

## 761 सत्यमेधा
He of true thoughts. "I have taken birth out of your womb." "I am born as a relative of yours." When श्री कृष्ण spoke to देवकी and the cowherd boys thus respectively, His idea that He really belonged to the same यादवा clan to which वासुदेव and the गोपा -boys belonged, was real and not that He outwardly acted like that (without that thought in His mind). So He is सत्यमेधाः . He verily spoke to the गोपा thus: "If you have a real love for Me and think of me as you think of yourselves (i.e. that I am a गोपा as all of you are).' "I am neither a god, nor a Gandharva, neither a यक्ष (demi-god) nor a दानव (demon). I am a born relative of you all. You must not think of me in any other way."

## 762 धराधरः
He who bore the mountain, Govardhana. When the angry Indra was giving trouble to all the cows and the cowherds, श्री कृष्ण thought: "The cowpen with all the cows and the cowherds should be protected by me now. I shall by force uproot this mountain with big boulders at once and hold it over their heads as a big umbrella and save them all (from this distress)."

## 763 तेजोवृषो
He Who showers splendour. Thus He showers splendour in the form of the protection of the good-hearted beings (cows and cowherds). So He is तेजोवृषः .

## 764 द्युतिधरः
He who possessed a majesty. Even in His young age कृष्ण had a superhuman majesty which cowed down Indra. Hence Dyuthi-dharah.

## 765 सर्वशस्त्रभृतां
वरः The best amongst those warrioir who are armed with all weapons. He was the foremost amongst those wlelders of weapons in His fights against Naraka (Asura), (King) जरासन्ध and others. "For the Lord of the world Who was diverting Himself with the activities of the human beings it was mere play to discharge different kinds of weapons against His enemies."

## 766 प्रग्रहः
The Controller like the reins. Arjuna was controlled as though by reins by श्री कृष्ण Who was his charioteer. Hence भगवान् is called Pragraha (the reins).

## 767 निग्रहः
The Subduer. All the enemies were subdued by श्री कृष्ण by His own supeior skill as a charioteer, without expecting the support of the valour of Arjuna. So He is called Nigraha.

## 768 व्यग्रः
He who was very zealous (enthusiastic). Inputting down the enemies of Arjuna, कृष्ण could not bear the delay in the normal process of the war; and so he Himself began to act as he did when he ruढed against भीष्म to attack Him. Vide "O सात्यकी ! (Sini-praviral) Those who have gone, have gone for ever. They who are here, let them also go at once. You will see now that भीष्म is thrown down from his chariot and also द्रोण along with his own army." So saying,कृष्ण jumped down from his chariot and leaving the horses advanced forward against भीष्म.)" And so on. (शिनि -प्रवीर - शिनि is the name of a warrior belonging to the यादवा clan.सात्यकी is his grandson, the son of सात्यक and his name was दृष्ठ-द्युम्न .) "The words 'राजा' (a leader), 'Indra' (foremost), 'agra' (first) etc. are iregularly formed with the affix ran." The word 'व्यग्र ' is derived from the root 'aga' (to move in a zigzag manner) preceded by the preposition 'vi'.

## 769 नैकशृङ्गः
He who adopted divesre tactics. He is Naika-srunga since He adopted several devices for bringing about the fall of the enemies like giving sound advice, skillfully driving the chariot, pretending that he would not use a weapon, but actually making use of His weapon at the opportune moment. The word 'srunga' is derived from the root 'sir' (to hurt). 'The affix 'gan' with the augment 'nuth' comes after the root 'sru'. The vowel isshortened and it is 'kith'. ('sru:' becomes 'sru').

## 770 गदाग्रजः
The elder brother of Gada. He was born before the boy गदा by name. गदा is the son of सुनामा, one of the wives of वासुदेव , and was younger than कृष्ण .

## 771 चतुर्मूर्तिः
He of Four Forms. The name of Chathur mu:rthi reminds us of the four व्युहा -s or Emanations which are the source for the Vibhava (Incarnations like राम and कृष्ण ). Even when He has taken birth in the Yadu-kula, He has four forms viz. Balabhadra, वासुदेव , Pradyuma and Aniruddha. (Bala-bhadra is the elder brother of कृष्ण ; Pradyumna is His on and Aniruddha His grandson.)

## 772 चतुर्बाहुः
The four armed. The source of the व्युहा-s or Emanations is the परारूप . (the Transcendental Form) and it was in this Form which is natural to Him that He took birth from देवकी . Both in the परा and व्युहा रूपा भगवान् has four arms and it was in this four-armed form that He was born of देवकी . When she was that form, she at once prayed to Him; "O The Inner Soul of all beings! Please withdraw this four armed form within Yourself. Let not this Kamsa that belongs to the Asura race know that you are the incarnation of विष्णु )."

## 773 चतुर्व्यूहः
He in the form od four Emanations. As in the case of the four व्युहा -s in which in one वासुदेव vyu:ha, He has all the six qualities and in the other three व्युहा in each he has two qualities. Similarly in the Vibhava अवतारा as कृष्ण , He as वासुदेव , has all the six qualities and in the other three बलराम , अनिरुद्ध and Pradyumna He has two qualities in each.

## 774 चतुर्गतिः
He who is in the form of the four goals or Purusharthas. He is Himself the four kinds of the पुरुषार्थाs-Dharma, Arttha, कामा and मोक्षा -according to the difference in the desires of the persons who seek refuge in Him. (Or He bestows the posts of Indra, Brahma, Kaivalya or मोक्षा according to their desires).

## 775 चतुरात्मा
The four-bodied. According to the capacity of the devotee to meditate on Him, भगवान् manifests Himself in the ascending order in four forms as जाग्रत (Wakeful state), Swapna (Dream state), सुष्प्ति (Deep sleep) and तुरीय (th Fourth). And in each of these four states He is in two forms, सूक्षम and स्थूल (subtle and Gross).

## 776 चतुर्भावः
He who displays four kinds of actions. The Four व्यूहा are वासुदेव , संकर्षण , Pradyumna and Aniruddha and every one of them has the four stages of जाग्रत् , Swapna, सुषुप्ति and तुर्य . Therefore in the four व्युहा-s there are sixteen forms. Creation, sustenance protection and propagation of the शास्र्रा-s are four duties, each one of which is subdivided into two parts as subtle and gross. भाव means भावना (i.e.displaying).

## 777 चतुर्वेदवित्
He who is known by those that are learned in the four Vedas. The superior mangnificence displayed in the व्यूहा and वैभव is vast like the ocean, and even those who are well versed in the four वेदा-s and who have a knowledge of the para and अपार (High and Low) are able to realise it only to an infinitely small extent and what they realise is like a drop in that big ocean of greatness.

## 778 एकपात्
He Whose Incarnation is only a part. Therefore the learned (seers) have said: "O ब्रह्मर्षी ! This Incarnation of the Lord as कृष्ण in the yadu race is only a small part of Himself." "He has come down to this world only with a part of a portion of Himself." "This greatnss of विष्णु is incomprehensible." "राम was directly a fourth part of विष्णु ."

## 779 समावर्तः
He who comes again and again. These Incarnations of the Lord as Vibhava and व्यूहा take place always, at all places, in all ways and all round. So He is called समावर्तः .

## 780 निवृत्तात्मा
He Whose mind is turned away. This incarnation of His which is associated with the world is done by Him due to His mercy. But His mind by itself is not affected by the worldly things. Therefore about Him it is said: "He does not speak (with any one); because there is no one greater than Him to be honoured by Him."

## 781 दुर्जयः
The invincible. It is impossible to bring Him under control by the ordinary power of the human or divine beings. "Who can seek and find Him out if He does not ढow Himself?" So, He is Durjayah.

## 782 दुरतिक्रमः
He Who cannot be dispensed with. He is Dur-athikrama, because there is no other refuge excepting His own feet; (against them no one should act). So it is stated in the श्रुती "If men succeed in rolling up the vast sky as a small leather-bag, then a person will be able to attain the end of his sufferings even without knowing God," (Even as the former is impossible, the latter also is difficult to achieve&) "Who can attain Salvation without worshipping वासुदेव ?" "All the वेदा-s are always singing in chorus that there is no other means of redemption except (the worship of) विष्णु . There is no doubt about this."

## 783 दुर्लभः
He Who is difficult to be attained. If the mind of a man goes after other things, Lord जनार्दन is beyond attainment." "O King! केशव cannot be attained by men if their senses are not conquered by them." So He is Durlabha.

## 784 दुर्गमः
He whom it is immpossible to attain. Just as the mid-day such cannot be seen by men with weak eyes, भगवान् Who is endowed with much more brilliance and splendour cannot be realised by weak-minded people. This is much more true by the maxim of दण्ड-अपूपिक . [दण्ड-अपूपिक-न्याय -The maxim of the stick and the cakes. When a stick and cakes are kept together and one says that the stick has been pulled down or eaten by the rats, we are naturally led to expect that the cakes also should have been pulled down or eaten by the rats as a matter of course, the two being so closely connected together. So, when one thing is closely connected with another in a particular way, and we say something of the one, it naturally follows that what we assert of the one can, as a matter of course, be asserted of the other.]

## 785 दुर्गः
He who cannot be entered into. He is impenetrable to those who are covered by curtains like nescience and others. "The affix 'da' comes after the verb 'gam' (to go) 'su' (well) and 'dur' (bad) when the resulting words denote location."

## 786 दुरावासः
He whose place of residence is not easy to attain. Consequently the attainment of life in the Transcendent World of His is difficult to attain.

## 787 दुरारिहा
The Dispeller of the evil minded enemies. The difficulty in the attainment of भगवान् mentioned above is only with reference to those who are great sinners and who are not eager to attain Him. This is being dealt with by the following twenty-four names (names 787 to 810). दुरारिण are those Who follow the evil path. He gets rid of them by several mans like making them give up the path of the वेदा-s. Vide in the वैष्णव ( पुराण ) - "By His powerful skill He confounded in several ways their minds and led them astray as a result of which there was not even one amongst them who had a liking for the वेदा-s. They became averse to go in the right path and they were easily disposed of by the gods."

## 788 शुभाङ्गः
He with a bewitching form. How did he get into their fold? It was by virtue of His charming figure-शुभाङ्गः . He had such a fascinating body by which He beguiled and deluded the असुरा-s. It made them think that he was an extremely trustworthy man.

## 789 लोकसारङ्गः
He who preached essential things in the world. How did He deceive them? लोक सारङ्गः-He explained to them that there are only two essential things in the world, enjoyment of the wordly pleasures and the attainment of salvation. He taught them this with appropriate reasons. Indeed He advised them to do as follows: "If you wish to attain salvation, follow my words." "The affix 'khach' comes after the verb 'gam' (to go) when a word ending in a case-affix is in composition with it. (शरम्+gam=सारङ्गः .) "The affix 'khach' may optionally be considered as if it had indicatory 'u'. The force of 'u' is to cause the elision of the final vowel with what follows it. (So the word may be सारङ्गः or सारङ्गमः .)

## 790 सुतन्तुः
He who had powerful net of threads. To capture the असुरा-s He had an attractive and inescapable snare of threads. He put on the appearance of tranquility and meditation. That snare of threads was good and when a person was caught in it he could never get out of it.

## 791 तन्तुवर्धनः
He who increases the meshes. Thus by aggravating the taste for sin in the minds of people He strengthens the snare of संसार as if by strong fibres. Vide "The worst of men are cruel and hate me. I always throw them into the cycle of संसार (Birth and death) in demoniac births."

## 792 इन्द्रकर्मा
He who did all this for the sake of Indra. "All the gods prostrated before Him and said: 'O Lord! Be mereciful towards us. Please save us from the असुरा-s. We seek refuge in ती ." For the sake of Indra and other gods who sought His protection, He acted in this way. So He is Indra कर्म .

## 793 महाकर्मा

## 799 रत्ननाभः

## 802 वाजसनिः
He who advocated eating much. By His atheistic teaching He created a tate in them for the enjoyment of pleasures in this world itself. He is वाजसनिः . It is the vow of a क्षपणक (a Buddhist monk) that he should devour mouthfuls of curd-rice every day in the morning. "The affix 'ini' is added to all roots."

## 804 जयन्तः
The Conqueror. He is Jayantha, because He conquered the advocates of Theism by means of His false doctrines that the world is an illusion and that the soul is nothing but knowledge.

The vast lake. He was a wide lake in which the evil-doers sink once for all never to rise up, as stated in the गीत - "I hurl the impious men continuously into the cycles of births and deaths in demoniacal wombs." Again He was a lake in which virtuous men bathe again and again, but never get satiated. So He was महाह्रदः. The word 'hrada' is derived from the root 'hrad' ( to make an indistinct sound). The lake is called 'hrada' since its waters are ever producing an indistinct noise. The long vowel 'आ' of 'hrada' is shortended as 'a' (in hrada) irregularly according to the rule 'prishodara etc".

## 810 महागर्तः
The Great Pit. In this way He sends into the great pits of Hell like Raurava all those who have lost their souls by the knowledge they have which is contrary to the teachings of the वेदा-s completely or partially. So He is called महागर्तः . Vide : "O Arjuna! The Slayer of the foes! Persons who have no faith in the Dharma taught by Me do not attain Me and continue to tread the path of the world of death." So far the quality of भगवान् as the punisher of those of Asuric temperament who voilate His ordinances has been described. Next the quality of भगवान् as the bestower of grace on those who are born with divine characteristics and who follow the path of the Scriptures is going to be delineated.

## 811 महाभूतः

The word 'Kundara' is irregularly formed like 'प्रषोदरादि '. 'The affix 'a' comes after a verbal root ending in long 'aa' when there is no preposition preceding it and when the object is in composition with it." "I bestow on them that knowledge (by which they attain Me)."

## 815 कुन्दः
He who grants the successive stages of higher knowledge. To those who have raised themselves by going up the steps of knowledge, non-attachment and so on. He allots the top higher and higher storeys of superior devotion and superior knowledge. So He is Kunda.(Para-bhakthi--A more intense devotion by which one entertains a great desire to realise the Brahman. परज्ञान is the perfect vision of God, which one gets just for a moment and which is the cause for the still greater devotion To Him." Or 'kum' is an irregularly formed word ending with the nasal 'm' which means sin. भगवान् is called कुन्दर, because He destroys the sin. (Kum+दारयति ). Again He is Kunda since He cleanses the sin which has been taken out. The affix 'da' in the word 'Kunda' is derived from the root 'daip' (to cleanse).

## 818 अनिलः
He who is not goaded by any one. He needs no one to goad Him into the act of blessing His devotees thus. Vide : "When meditated upon भगवान् मधुसूदन grants His blessings even when one does not pray for them." Anilah is derived from the root 'ila' (to urge). 'ila' is that person who urges another to do an act. भगवान् is 'Anila' (without an inducer) since there is no one to induce Him to save His devotees; for He does it by Himself. "After a verb ending in a consonant, but preceded by 'I' 'u' or 'ri' long or short, and after the verbs 'ज्ञ', 'प्री ' and 'क्री', comes the affix 'ka' (a).

## 822 सर्वतोमुखः
He forwhom there are ways of approache from all sides He has not laid down any rule that He can be easily attained only by a particular means and not by any other. On the other hand He is so accessible that He can be easily attained by some means however trifling it may be. Vide : "If a peson seeks refuge with a desire for immediate help (i.e. aarta) or with endurance of delay (i.e. drptha) (he should be protected by those who know the शास्त्रा-s even though the person who comes is his enemy).

## 823 सुलभः
He who can be easily attained. Even though He is priceless, it is possible to buy Him with the semblance of a price.

## 824 सुव्रतः
He of good vow. He is Suvratha, because He takes a strong vow to protet those who come to Him by some means or other. "To him who has sought my protection only once (and begged of me saying 'I am Thine', to him I give protection from all beings.

## 825 सिद्धः
He who is attained. He is attained by those without any effort who have the correct knowledge of His true nature. This quality of protecting His devotees is not conditioned by anything, but it is always natural to Him and it is ever existent in Him.

## 826 शत्रुजित्
शत्रुतापनः . He chastises the enemies of the world through Kakuthsttha, Purukuthsa and others by infusing His own divine prowess into them. Vide the fourth Amsa of वैष्णव (i.e. विष्णु पुराण ); "In the fight between the gods and the demons. King Puranjaya sat on the hump of the bull (which form Indra had taken), and being infused with the power of भगवान् अच्युत who was very angry with the असुरा-s He killed all the असुरा-s " (Allusion : Mythology relates that, when, in their war with the demons, the gods were often worsted, they, headed by Indra, went to the powerful Puranjaya, and requested him to help them in battle. The latter consented to do so provided Indra carried him on his shoulders. Indra accordingly assumed the form of a bull and Puranjaya seated on its hump, completely vanquished the demons (endowed as he was with the prowess of भगवान् ). The same is mentioned in the episode of Purukuthsa also. "King Puru-kuthsa went to the Nether-world, रसातल by name, and being filled with the prowess of भगवान् , killed all the गन्धर्वा-s (who were giving trouble to the नागा-s (serpents) there."

## 827 न्यग्रोधोदुम्बरः
He Who is controlled by those who stand below bowing to Him and Who is the master of the superior Transcendental World. भगवान् is न्यग्रोध and also उदुम्बर . Therefore He is न्यग्रोधोदुम्बरः . He is न्यग्रोध , because He is prevented from going elsewhere by those who stand below praying for a favourable glance of His. Vide -- "Anjali-the act of joining the hands in supplication is a great symbol which pleases the Lord at once without delay." (In the same lines is the advice of Hanuman to सुग्रीव )-- "(O सुग्रीव !) Since an offence has been committed by you I see no other atonement for you than to pacify लक्षमण and beg his pardon with folded hands." He is उदुम्बर ; that is He has Ambara (the Supreme abode which rises far above all other things by its magnificent qualities (ut)-- the Supreme Abode which includes within itself लक्षमी , attendants etc. So the name न्यग्रोधोदुम्बर signfies that though He is worshipped by the highest of personages, He is within the easy reach of the lowest, (because it is possible to please Him easily)". This is clearly seen in the texts like श्री वैष्णव where it is said : "भगवान् पुरुषोत्तम , Who is the आदि-पुरुष , was requested by the serpents to help them from the trouble given by the गन्धर्व-s, मौनेया-s, by name." (मौनेया-s --This is the metronymic name of चित्रसेन and other गन्धर्वा-s who were the sons of Muni, the wife of the sage Kasyapa.) The word Udumbara has been irregularly formed under the प्रषोदरादि rule. The word Udumbara is a compound word from the two words 'ud'+'ambara'. Normally it should be उदुम्बर . But the first letter 'a' of the word 'ambara' has been changed into 'u' and therefore it comes under the प्रषोदरादि rule. Then begins the topic of the rule of the world by भगवान् through the different gods who are like His limbs. In this state He is known by the name of 'प्रादुर्भावान्तर '.

## 828 अश्वत्थः
He who stands as the controller of the worlds through gods who are transitory. He Who stands as the controller of the worlds through (Indra and other) gods who are transitory. The name Asvathtthah is derived as follows : He stands as the ruler of Indra and others who occupy posts that are temporary. They are not permanent because they ar in existence on one day and the next day they perish. (a-sva-ntho in the morrow). The formation of this word also comes under the पृषोदरादि rule. Vide in the वैष्णव : "Residing within the body of Brahma, composed of रजोगुण , भगवान् creates the world. He takes the body of विष्णु composed of Saththva, and protects the world. Assuming the body of काल (Siva) composed of तमो गुण , He swallows the Universe."

## 829 चाणूरान्ध्रनिषूदनः
He who slew the wrestler Chanoora by name. He killed the Asura-andhra wrestler चाणूर by name who was the enemy of Indra and others. 'Niढu:dana' is derived from the root 'su:d' (to kill)with the preposition 'ni'. (ni+सूद ). 'The 's' of 'सूद' is changed to 'ष' like words 'सुषम etc." चाणूरान्ध्र -a man of low caste चाणुर by name.

## 830 सहस्रार्चिः
The Thousand rayed. भगवान् is Sahasra-archih since He is the presiding Lord Who bestowed thousands of beneficent rays on the Sun god which (rays) have the qualities of ripening, drying, and illuminating, Vide in श्री पौष्का "Know that the Sun and the Moon are the two eye-gods in an embodied form of the Supreme Deity परमात्म whose name is अग्नीषोमात्म " "That light which, being in the Sun, illuminates the entire Universe, that in the Moon and that in the fire,-- understand all that light is only mine."

## 831 सप्तजिह्वः
The Seven-tongued. The seven tongues of the fire, काले , कराले etc. are His and they have been allotted the duties of nourishing the gods, receving the oblations and carrying them (to the respective gods). Vide in Pauढkara : "The Supreme Lord in the form of Hutha-bhuk (i.e. fire) carries to the gods who have fire as their mouth, the offerings which are sanctified by the मन्त्रा -s and made in a sacrifice along with clarified butter and thereby always pleases the entire world of the Brahmic egg." (The seven tongues of the fire-काले ,कराले ,मनोजवा , सुलोहिता, सुधूम्र-वर्णा ,स्फुलिङगिनी , and वीश्वरूपी . Agni-भगवान् is said to have seven flames whose names are हिरण्या , कनका ,रक्ता, कृष्णा, सुप्रभा ,अतिरक्ता and भहुरूप.)

## 832 सप्तैधाः
He who shines like fire with the seven kinds of fuel भगवान् is the object of worship of all pious deeds for which the पाक -यज्ञ , हविर्-यज्ञ and सोमा -समस्ता , each one of which is seven in number, act as fuel for fire. Doing sacrifices and digging wells also are for His worship. He is again worshipped by the sacrifices in which the sticks of seven kinds of trees are used for kindling the fire. पाक यज्ञ -औपासन , वैस्वदेव , स्ताले-पाक , अष्टका-श्राद्धा, monthly ceremonies,ईसान and Sarpa-bali. Havir-yajna-Agni-hओthra, Darsa-pओrna-मासा , Pindapithr-yajna, Pasu-bandha,आग्रयान, चतुर्मास्य and सौत्रामणी . Sओma-samstha-Agni-ष्टोम , Athyagni-ष्टोम , Ukthya, षोदश , वाज्पेय, अतिरात्र and अप्तोर-याम . The sticks of seven forest trees that bear fruit apparently without any blossoms are used in sacrifices. Those trees are : the palasa tree, the baniyan tree, the fig tree, the jack tree,सामी , Asani-natha and पुष्कर-पर्ण .)

## 833 सप्तवाहनः
He who has seven vehicles. भहवान् has seven vehicles in the form of the horses or the Sun's chariot which are the presiding deities of the वेदिc मन्त्राs that reveal Him and that are couched in the seven Metres गायत्री i etc. The वेदाs declare : "The seven vital airs are born of Him." "The seven are placed by परमात्मा who lies in the inner cave." Or (the name may be interpreted as follows): He Who controls the seven regions of air. Vide in पौष्कर : "वायु is the name of the presiding deity which gets its strength from the life-breath of the Lord of the World and it carries on the work of the Universe in different regions or strata. All these are like parks for the universal Lord in the three worlds." (Here the seven vital airs are the five sensory organs, mind and intellect.) (The seven regions of air are आवाह ,प्रवाह ,सम्वाह , उद्वाह , विवाह , परिवाह , and प्रवाह ). Seven Vedic Metres गायत्री , उष्णिक , अनुष्टुप् ,बृहती , पंङ्कती , तृष्टुप् ,जगती .

## 834 अमूर्तिः
He Who has not the form of others. The name Amu:rthih signifies that His form is quite different from the gross bodies of others which are composed of the five elements.

## 835 अनघोः
The Sinless. He is not subject to Karma and so He is entirely different from the जीवा-s who are under its control.

## 836 अचिन्त्यः
He who surpasses all thought. He cannot be described by comparing Him even with the Mukthँs.

## 837 भयकृद्
He who cause fear.

## 838 भयनाशनः
He who dispels fear. भगवान् is the source of fear ( भयकृद् ) in the case of those who transgress His commands, and destroys the fear (भय-नाशन ) of those who obey them. "कृष्ण is the cause of fear as well as its remover."

## 839 अणुः
The Atom He is an Atom (अणु ) since He has the capacity to enter into the infinitesimally small void space known as 'दहर आका' in the heart of beings, into Avyaktha (i.e. Prakruthi), and also into the subtle जीवा . अणु here means that he is extremely subtle. The word 'anu' derived from the verb 'anathi' which means 'goes'. After the root 'an' comes the affix 'u'. "He is a much smaller atom than the atom itself." "He is powerful and is more subtle than the fibre of the lotus stalk".

## 840 र्बृहत्
The great. The extent of His pervasion is such that even the vast Transcendental World (Parama-pada) appears to be just in a corner of His body which surpasses that of cotton, wind etc., His movement is unimpeded on all sides. So He is Krusa. From the context it must be taken that the thinness here signifies lightness. Vide : "He pervaded the Earth in all its entirety and stood up beyond it by 'Dasa-angula." (Though the word Dasa-angula means ten inches' here 'dasa' means endless and 'angula' means yojana). "He is greater than the great." "He is greater than the Earth." "The words 'prahath', 'brhath 'manath and 'jagath' are formed by the affix 'athi' and it is like the 'sathr' affix. The force of the affix is to denote the present tense like the 'sathr' affix." So the root 'brh' has the affix 'ari' and the rule is that it denotes present tense.

## 841 कृशः
He who is thin. Because of the lightness of His body which surpasses that of cotton, wind etc. His movement is unimpeded on all sides. So He is Krisa. From the context it must be taken that the thinness here signifies lightness. Vide : "Inscrutable is भागा , He cannot be ordered by any one. He can go wherever He chooses." 'Krusa' is derived from the root 'krs' (to spread or extend). The affix 'ka' has been added under the rule. "After a verb ending in a consonant, but preceded by 'I' 'u' or 'ri' (long or short), comes the affix 'ka' (a)."

## 842 स्थूलः
He who is immense. He has the ability to touch all things directly Himself remaining in one place. Standing on the earth, He can also touch the Moon, He is endowed with such superior power. So He is स्थूलः .

## 843 गुणभृत्
The supporter of all that are subject to him. He makes all things in all their states subject to Him by His mere, will and supports them. So he is गुणा-भ्रुता This is His supreme power of ruling over all. "He keeps all under control and rules over them all."

## 844 निर्गुणः
He who is bereft of the qualities of others. Even though He is in contact with all, He is not tainted by their defects since He is not subject to any one and is above all of them. He is extremely independent. This is His supreme power of holding others in magical submission to His will. "He bewitches the entire world with its wide-open eyes." "Saththa and other qualities that are in the Prakruthi have no place in भगवान् , the ruler."

## 845 महान्
The great. He is महान् , great. he has the superior power of achieving whatever He desires to have. (This is the power known as' प्राकाम्य); there is nothing that can obstruct what he desires to do. Even into the earth He can plunge and emerge out of it as one does in water. This power He has to the highest extent and so He is महान् . Vide : "The powerful Lord, Sauri, acts as He chooses. He unites and separates things as He likes. Whatever He chooses to do, He an accompliढ it without any effort." "The words 'पृषत् ' (sprinkle), 'बृहत् ' (to increase), 'महत् ' (to wroship) and 'jagath' (to go) are formed by the affix 'athi' which denotes the present tense as the 'satr' suffix does.

## 846 अधृतः
The Uncontrolled. It is said that the fulfilment of one's desires is achieved in four ways : (1) Controlling the mind of another by entering the shadow of another (2) Subjecting the mind of another by constant meditation (3) entering into the body of another when he is alive or even after his death and (4) directing the conduct of sacrifices and digging of wells and tanks. भगवान् is called Adhrutha, because He has such omnipotence and omnipresence that He is not 'dhrutha' or impeded in His actions. All this superior power is quite natural to Him based on His own free will. This is seen in the case of श्री कृष्ण. "Therefore it is said about Him. By His mere will the sons of the Vaidika-Brahmin were able to reach the Paramapada (the Transcendental World) from which there is nromally no return even though they had not attained perfection in meditation; and they came back because of His will to bring them back to the world of rebirth. Again though He has the power to change the nature of the sentient जीवात्मा and the non-sentient Prakruthi, for some inscrutable reason He does not bring about such a change.

## 847 स्वधृतः
He whose sovereignty is innate. The name स्वधृतः distinguishes the sublime nature of परमात्मा from the greatness of the bound souls which is acquired by them by means of incantations, herbs, austerities and meditation. This sublimity of the परमात्मा is not dependent on meditation etc., but it is natural to Him. So He is Sva-dhruthah.

## 848 स्वास्यः
He who has a glorious status. The status and glory of भगवान् is distinguished here from that of the मुक्ता-s (or Released souls). 'आस्य ' means status. भगवान्'s status is always magnificent. In the case of the Muktha, his stately nature, though innate to him, was clouded once by Nescience and it has become manifest only after release from संसार . It is not so with भगवान् since it is always manifest. "Also after a verb ending in long 'आ', when there is a preposition along with it, the affix 'ang' comes (when the noun formed is in feminine gender)."

## 849 प्राग्वंशः
He who is the cause of the eternally free souls. The name प्राग्वंशः distinguishes Him from the eternally free souls (the नित्याs) by virtue of His glory. "Parama-pada is the place of विष्णु where from time immemorial the साध्य-देवाs (i.e. eternally free angels) live." As stated in this Sruthi text, the word 'प्राग् ' signifies the eternally free souls. He is their 'vamsa'--the cause for their superior status. If their essential nature and their glory is eternally manifest, it is due to Him. It is undisputed and accepted by all that all things in all ways depend on His will. All this (that has been delineated in the four names (846 to 849) is summarised by the following sloka in the वैष्णव (पुराण ) thus: "O Lord! In this way Thy glory is superior, inborn and unexcelled. Therefore how can I fully describe it and praise Thee?"

## 850 वंशवर्धनः
He who keeps His progeny growing. He is Vamsa-vardhana since He is the cause for keeping in tact the respective essential nature of all beings that are different from Him. Here the 'Vamsa' or the race signifies the hosts of eternally free Angels and the सिद्धा-s who are like His pedigree and who have been mentioned just previously. He goes on increasing them. Vide : "I prostrate before the Lord Who keeps His followers ever around Him."

## 851 भारभृत्
he who shoulders the burden. In the case of the मुकेता-s (or Released souls) also, He bears the burden of bringing about their release from the bondage of the world, the manifestation of their essential nature and the attainment to Himself.

## 852 कथितः
He who has been revealed as such. The authority for this quality of His is shown by the name Katthithah. It is stated in all शास्त्रा-s that He is possessed of all the qualities described above and also about to be described hereafter. "In the वेदाs, the पुरुषs , the अङ्गाs and the subsidiary अङ्गा-s Thy greatness is sung." "O the foremost amongst the descendents of बारता ! विष्णु is praised everywhere--in the वेदाs, in the रामायण and in the sared महाभारत in the beginning, the middle as well as in the end". "He is the superior object that is denoted by all words."

## 853 योगी
He Who is endowed with super-human powers. The name योगी signifies that all that has been stated about Him is quite possible in Him. There is a unique greatness in Him of bring about a harmonious combination of things that generally do not go together. Such greatness is in an extreme measure and is quite natural to Him. So the scriptural texts declare : "Look at the great योग of Mine Who am the Lord." "कृष्ण , the Lord of योग ." "योग that has sprung from कृष्ण , the Lord of योग." "Hari, that Supreme Lord of योग ." And so on.

## 854 योगीशः
He who is the foremost Lord of all yogins.. He bears the burden of bringing about the perfection of the योगा even in the case of Sanaka and other योगिन्s who are possessed of powers of meditation natural to them even though they are in the midst of souls in bondage. "He conferred the highly pure goal, namely Vaikuntta, upon Sanaka and other sages wo were flawless.

## 855 सर्वकामदः
The bestower of all desires. Even to those whose practice of योगा has been adversely affected. He grants their desires and bestows the power of अणिमा etc., though it is an impediment in the path of Salvation. Vide : "They reach the worlds of those who have done meritorious deeds and live there for a long number of years."

## 856 आश्रमः
He who provides an abode for rest for them. When they return from the meritorious worlds, He makes them take birth in the houses iof श्री वैष्णवा-s where real knowledge of the Lord can be had in profusion and they can become refreshed. "He who has swerved from the path of योगा he had begun, is born again in the abode of pure and pious devotees."

## 857 श्रमणः
He who makes them continue their Yoga. In the case of those whose latent impressions of the योगा they had begun had not been exhausted either by the enjoyment of the fruits of their Karma or by their births. भगवान् helps them to resume their योगिc practice without much effort. "There (in his new birth) the योगी gains the knowledge of the योगा that he had been practising in the previous birth." "For 'yu' and 'vu' nasalised in an affix 'Iyu'--'nvul' are substituted respectively 'an' and 'ak'." (sram+Iyu=sram+an=श्रमणः).

## 858 क्षामः
He who helps the Yogi to become well-equipped. Even those, who have fallen from the practice of योगा , are blessed with strength to cross the unfordable ocean of संसार if they show but an inclination to resume the योगा that they have discontinued. "Dear Arjuna! He who begins to do a good thing never goes to damnation." "The affix 'ghajn' comes after the root 'kढam' (to be capable of)."

## 859 सुपर्णः
He who helps ( the Yogins) to cross the ocean of Samsara). When once they begin to resume the योगा (left incomplete in their previous birth). He helps them to complete the योगा and reach the shore beyond the region of darkness. The मौलाs say : "The Lord leads them to reach the shore." "He attains perfection in योगा by practising it in several births and reaches the Supreme Abode."

## 860 वायुवाहनः
He Who lifts up by swift wind like Garuda. वायु here is used to signify Garuda, the lord of birds, who is noted for his swiftness of movement. With the help of Garuda, भगवान् lifts up those who have fallen down because of very powerful causes and makes them reach the other sore. So He is called वायु-वाहनः . By way of illustration we have the story of King Uparichara-वासु . वासु was a very great devotee of भगवान् n. Due to the curse of a great sage he was wandering in the nether worlds. भगवान् rescued him by means of Garuda and again made him move about in upper worlds Vide in the विष्णु तत्व : "Or the Garuda, the king of birds, will come to him quickly and carry him to the abode of भगवान् (the master of Garuda)."

## 861 धनुर्धरः
The wielder of the bow. In order to remove the thorns in the path of His devotees performing योगा in this manner, भगवान् is Himself wielding His bow, सारंग . "It is for this reason that the bow is wielded by the क्षत्रिया-s in this world." "The bow is always carried by the क्षत्रिया-s so that there may not be the cry of distress anywhere."

## 862 धनुर्वेदः
The propounder of the Science of Archery. Even those like the ruler of the gods and those of men acquire a knowledge of archery and other things from Him Who is the propounder of all such शास्त्रा s.

## 863 दण्डः
The source of punishment (for the wicked) wicked as per the rules of laws and bring happiness to the world by following the rules of dharma as laid down by the वेदा-s. "The affix 'da' comes after a verb ending in a nasa!" 'दण्ड ' is derived from 'dam' (to subdue). (dam+da=दण्ड ).

## 864 दमयिता
The Subduer. He as राम directly was in the habit of putting down wicked persons like रावण and others.

## 865 अदमः
He who is not subdues by any one. There is not one who can subdue Him like this -- Adamah. Vide : "जनार्दन by his mere will can turn into ashes the entire Universe. But all the Universe combined together can do no harm to Him."

## 866 अपराजितः
The invincible. While the power of भगवान् to rule over others is all comprehensive, his actions cannot be obstructed by any one at any time anywhere or by any means. Vide : "कृष्ण Who is invincible." "What is there in this world that cannot be conquered by that person who has भगवान् Hari as his mentor, protector and friend?"

## 867 सर्वसहः
He Who supports all. He bears all other gods who are, by His command, the objects of worship for those who are not fully equipped. So He is Sarva-sahah.

## 868 नियन्ता
He who diercts. He directs and controls the tastes of others in the worship of their respective deities. "Whichever devotee desires to worhsip with faith whichever form of Mine,-(in relation to such devotee, I make that same faith of his unढakable and firm)".

## 869 नियमः
He who ordains. "In accordance with His faith a person attempts to worship that manifestation; and thence he obtains the objects of his desire. They are in fact bestowed by Me alone." "And the affix 'ap', comes optionally after the verb 'yam' (to control) when the preposition 'sam', 'upa', 'ni', and 'vi' are in composition or even when it is preposition-less.

## 870 यमः
The controller. It is He that controls others also like Yama who are the bestowers of the respective fruits. Vide : "विष्णु has got the power to control me also"--says Yama. Thus far the Lord has been delineated as presiding over the two qualities of रजस् and तमस् predominant in the worshippers.

## 871 सत्त्ववान्
He Who has the quality of Sattva (under his control) He presides directly over the Saththva-गुण which has the qualities of lustre, lightness and bliss and which therefore is the cause of Salvation. Vide : "The Great Lord is the supreme Person Who guides the flow or the movement of Saththva-गुण ." The qualities of रजस् and तमस् are being manipulated by Him through me medium of Brahma and Siva respectively. The Lord says in the वराह पुराण : "A being is released from bondage because of the quality of Saththva in him. Saththva is indeed नारायण Himself If a person has the quality of रजस् coupled with सत्तव , he becomes a man of wealth and great fame." "It is declared in all the शास्त्रा s that it is the nature of Brahma when रजास् becomes associated with तमस् . In fact He is also Myself (i.e. He is controlled by Me). There is no doubt about it."

## 872 सात्विकः
He that has Sattva-guna. It is quite fitting to associate the सत्व गुण with भगवान् because it is He that dispenses the fruits of dharma, knowledge, non-attachment and riches. "The affix 'thak' comes with a verb in the sense of 'who deserves that."

## 873 सत्यः
The truth. Since, He is delineated by the सात्विक शास्त्रास् , all the greatness attributed to Him is true and so He is Sathya. "कृष्णा is rooted in सत्यः and सत्यः is rooted in कृष्णा . Existence and non-existence (saththa and asaththa) are grounded on गोविन्द . So great men opine that कृष्णा is Truth itself."

## 874 सत्यधर्मपरायणः
He who is pleased with the true Dharma. The noble Dharma (viz. Nivruththi-dharma) which is practised by pious men with no ulterior motive is said to please Him most. They follow that Dharma because it has been laid down in the सात्विक शास्त्रास्

## 875 अभिप्रायः
He who is the object of choice. He is the highest goal sought after by His devotees who are pure by nature, practise the सात्विक धर्म , and are not hankering after other low pleasures.

## 876 प्रियार्हः
He who is rightly the object of love. He is rightly qualified to bless the devotee who meditates on Him and for whom He is the highest goal. भगवान् is naturally attached to those who are exclusively devoted to Him; If He is generous towards those who resort to Him for getting back the lost wealth or for the realisation of their own आत्मा , it is only because of His managanimity and generosity. "Of all those who are devoted to me, ज्ञानी (the man of knowledge) is really the best because of his exclusive devotion to Me and of his desire to be associated with Me always." "All these (four kinds of devotees) are really generous (because they come to Me for fulfilling the desires).

## 877 अर्हः
The fitting person. He is the right Deity to be sought after by His devotees who have no desire for anything other (than Him). "He Who is attached to Me and has his mind fixed on Me attains Me, the supreme goal."

## 878 प्रियकृत्
He who does what is wanted by others. Even though some people are attached to other things if they worship Him, He grants their desires and makes them His devotees. Even though the minds of some people are drawn towards worldly things, if they once come to Me to worship Me) "I make them take a liking for the practice of Karma without having an eye on its fruit."

## 879 प्रीतिवर्धनः
He Who enhances their joy. Again by manifesting His qualities more and more, He increases the joy of His devotees. "On those who meditate on Me, with love, I confer that knowledge of योगा (by which they attain Me)."

## 880 विहायसगतिः
He Who is the means for the attainment of the Paramapada It is because of Him that those who have reached the highest stage of Bhakthi, attain the supreme abode (परमपद ). So He Himself has said : "Having enjoyed great pleasures in abundance, through My grace, you will remember Me at the last moment and will begin to live in my world." The Brahma सूत्र says : "Because of the efficacy of Bhakthi योग that has been practised by a devotee and because of the constant meditation on the path which leads to Paramapada, there springs a lustre at the tip of the heart which is the seat of the आत्म . Through the grace of the Lord residing in his heart the उपासका is able to see the opening by which he has to go; he then leaves the body through that particular nerve called सुषुम्न which will lead him to the path of the supreme abode and which is different from the other one hundred nerves that will lead a person to places other than the superior abode."

## 881 र्ज्योतिः
The Light. This is the first step in the Supreme Abode. This is the first step in the Supreme Abode. This is called Jyothi because things are illuminated by it. "They reach Archih (the domain of Light)". (The words 'Archih' and Jyotih' are synonyms.) Archih and other deities are known as 'आतिवाहिका-s' (Escorting Angels), because they have pleased the Lord and earned His grace by their उपासना or Meditation). This topic has been discussed in the following Brahma सूत्रा-s : "The मुक्ताs (Released Souls) are led along the stages beginning with Archi (Light), and this is well-known in the उपनिषद्c Texts." "Archih and other deities are known as आतिवाहिका-s (Escorting Angels) because of the nature of their duty which is to lead the मुक्ता-s to the Supreme Abode." (There are twelve such Escorting Angels and Archih is the first. The others are : 2. Ahas (day); 3. Sukla-पक्ष (the bright fortnight); 4. उत्तरायण (Summer solstice); 5. Samvathsara (Year); 6. वायु (Wind); 7. Su:rya (Sun); 8. Chandra (Moon); 9. Vidyuth (Lightning); 0. वरुण (Lord of the ocean); 11. Indra (Lord of gods); and 12. Brahma (the Creator); Names 881 to 889 are said to signify the twelve Escorting Angels who are presided over by भगवान् .)

## 882 सुरुचिः
He of lovely effulgence. The day is effulgent because of the Sun-rise. भगवान् is Suruchi since, He is endowed with that lovely effulgence. "From the Light to the Day" is the Sruthi. (The deity presiding over Day is the next escort appointed by the Lord for the Muktha. This is the second step in the path beginning with Archi.) "After a verb ending in a consonant, but preceded by 'I', 'u', 'r' (long or short), comes the affix 'kith'". The affix 'in has been added to the verb to denote the sense of the Nominative case. There is the 'kith' affix also.

## 883 हुतभुग्विभुः
He that is the light fortnight. (This is one name. Here Hutha-bhuk signifies the Moon who consumes (bhuk) what is offered in the fire (hutha) after turning it into nectar. भगवन् is that half of the month in which the moon waxes into full moon i.e. the light fortnight consuming the sacrifical offering which turn into nectar. (This is the third step in the Archir-आदि path-the Path beginning with Archi.) "From the Day to the growing Fortnight (Sukla-पक्ष ).

## 884 रविः
He who is praised by virtue of His being the Summer solstice. उत्तरायण is the period in which the Sun begins his movement towards the North. भगवान् is called Ravi by virtue of His being praised (रूयते ) thus (This is the fourth step in the आर्चिरादिमार्ग .) "(They attain) from the bright fortnight the six months which belong to the northern progress of the Sun."

## 885 र्विरोचनः
The Illuminant. भगवान् is the year which illuminates the Sun when he rises his chariot through the two अयनाs (periods of six moths. i.e. उत्तरायण and दक्षिणायण (the Summer solsticeand the winter solstice). (This is the fifth step). "From the months (they attain) the year." "This Sun is the Year."

## 886 सूर्यः
The source of movement for the wind. He is called सूर्य since the Wind always moves out of Him. "The words "राज-सूर्य " 'सूय ' etc. Are irregularly formed by the addition of the affix 'क्यप् )." As the rule with reference to the 'krit' and Iyut' affixes has got wide application, and the meaning of the 'kruth' affix also is not restricted, we can interpret a word with the 'kruth' affix in a way suitable to the context. ( The word 'सूर्य ' is derived from 'sr' (to move) and is given the desired meaning.) "He (the जीव ) goes to the वायुलोक ." This is the sixth step in the Archirdi Path'

## 887 सविता
He who produces (i.e. the sun) भगवान् produces through the Sun as the medium rain crops etc. Therefore He is called Savitha (आदित्या ). "(The जीव ) goes from the Year to आदित्या ." "वायु (has to come) after the year, because of general and particular terms to show it." It is pertinent to introduce वायु between the Samvathsara and the आदित्या since, there are Upanishadic texts which declare that the जीवा goes from the संवत्सर (Year) to वायुलोक i.e. 'देव लोक'. So it must be taken that the जीव goes from the संवत्सर to वायु , and from there to the Sun. (who is the seventh step in the Path).

## 888 रविलोचनः
He Who illuminates through the rays of the sun. भगवान् is रविलोचन since, He makes the Moon the Lightning and वरुण shine by means of the Sun's rays reflecting on them. These three are the eighth, ninth and tenth steps in the अर्चरादि पाठ .) "(The जीवा goes) from the आदित्या to the Moon, and from the Moon to the Lightning." "Then He goes to वरुण लोक ."

## 889 अनन्तहुतभुग्भोक्ता
he who is Indra and Brhama of immeasureable greatness. He Who is Indra and Brahma of immeasurable greatness. Indra is called 'Hutha-bhuk', because he consumes what is offered as an oblation in sacrifices in the fire. Brahma is called भोक्ता because He is the protector of the beings in the Universe. Both of them possessed of immense greatness are under His control. so भगवान् is Anantha-hutha bhuk-भोक्ता . Indra and Brahma work for the Lord in escorting the जीवा in the Archiradi-Path. They are the eleventh and twelth steps which are the last in the Path.) "He (the released soul) comes to the Indra लोक ; and then he comes to the प्रजापति लोक (i.e. the world of Brahma)."

## 890 सुखदः
The giver of the bliss. By the touch of अमानव ( a celestial deity) the Lord dispels the contact with the world along with the latent impressions and confers Bliss on the जीवा when the latter reaches Him. He is Sukhadah. "Then the Celestial पुरुष ,अमानव by name comes and leads these freed souls to the Supreme Being."

## 891 नैकदः
He Who is the lord of those who give many things. They who give only one thing are 'एकदा-s'. Unlike these 'नैकदाs' are those who give not one, but many things. Here भगवान् is called 'Naikada' because He has many celestlals as His attendants who are well-versed in the art of giving reception to the मुक््ता-s and who bestow countless garlands, pigment, clothes, etc. on them. The कौष्ताकिन्s declare : "Five hundred अपसरा-s (divine damsals rush forth to receive the Muktha. A hundred of them have garlands in their hands, and another hundred have the pigment in their hands to decorate him" and so on. "They adorn him with the adornments of the Brahman itself."

## 892 अग्रजः
He Who manifests Himself before the Muktas. When the मुक्ताs reach Him, भगवान् , along with लक्षमी , the ruler of the Universe, manifests Himself to them and both of them become objects of enjoyment for them. This is delineated in the Paryanka-vidya (of कौषिताकि Upanishad). The passage in the कौषिताकि Upanishad begins with these words : "He (the Muktha) comes to the Couch (Paryanka) of great splendour." And proceeds : 'The Supreme Brahman is seated on it with लक्षमी beside Him and the attendants around Him. The Muktha (Who has meditated upon the Lord in this manner) and who now realises Him, places his foot on the couch and climbs it. Brahman asks him, 'Who are you?" And the text concludes : "The knowledge that Brahman has, the Muktha acquires; and the Bliss that is Brahman's he enjoys that bliss."

## 893 अनिर्विण्णः
He who is not despondent. भगवान् with great solicitude and mercy, lifts up His devotee from the girth of संसार and makes him attain Him. Seeing that the Muktha is no longer an object of compassion, the Lord is free from despondency and sorrow, like राम . "(राम crowned विभीषण as the King of Lanka). Then राम felt that He had carried out what He proposed to do and felt immensely happy, indeed!."

## 894 सदामर्षी
He who is ever patient. Thenceforward it is the habit of भगवान् to help the Muktha in the fulfilment of his desire to do service to Him by way of return for what परमात्म has done him. He also accepts with forbearance all the services that the Muktha does. So भगवान् is सदामर्षी . The Sruthi also declares : "The Muktha enjoys all the desirable and fascinating qualities of Brahman as well as Brahman itself."

## 895 लोकाधिष्ठानम्
The Support of the worlds. "In the best of worlds of unsurpassed excellence"--As stated in this Sruthi there are worlds which are enjoyed by the Muktha. Paramँthma is the eternal supporter of all those worlds.

## 896 अद्भुतः
He who is extreamely wonderful. And there He is wonderful. Even though He is enjoyed by all ways, still He is a source of wonder as if unseen before. "The affix 'duthach' comes after the root 'भू ' (to be) preceded by 'ath' (an indeclinable meaning 'sudden')."

## 897 सनात्
The object of enjoyment. भगवान् confers perfect enjoyment of Bliss equally on all the मुक्ता-s."Sanah' and 'सनात ' are listed in the गण-पाठ as irregularly formed words."

## 898 सनातनतमः
The most Ancient. In this way He is eternally so. His form is most ancient, (i.e. eternal). Even in the past He was new. (पुराण ) Despite the fact that extstence is eternal, He is always more enjoyable and fresh, as though He is new and not seen before.

## 899 कपिलः
He who is effulgent. Of what form is He? His radiant form in the self-luminous Vaikuntta is very much like a blue cloud in the midst of sparkling streaks of lightenings.

## 900 कपिरव्ययः
He who enjoys the never. Decreaseign bliss. He also experiences the pleasure of the enjoyment of His Bliss, or He keeps it safe (without destruction). "The affix 'in' comes after all roots." The long 'आ' of the root 'पा' (to protect or to drink) has been dropped. (Kam+पा=कपिः ).

## 901 स्वस्तिदः
The giver of the Auspiciousness. In this way does He give supreme auspiciousness to all.

## 902 स्वस्तिकृत्
The master of Auspiciousness He blesses the Mukthas by making them enjoy Him and His qualities.

## 903 स्वस्ति
He Who is Auspiciousness. He Who is Himself Auspiciousness incarnate," "Svasti' signifies auspiciousness and benediction." "The affix 'ti' comes after the root 'as' (to be) when preceded by the preposition 'su'." Because of the addition of the affix 'शित्', 'भू ' is not substituted in the place of 'as'."

## 904 स्वस्तिभुक्
The Protector of Auspiciousness. भगवान् protects all this auspiciousness and preserves them.

## 905 स्वस्तिदक्षिणः
He who has Auspiciousness to be given as Dakhshinaa or fee in the sacrifice. Bhagavan is performing, as if it were, a long sacrifice in which He offers His own self to His devotees. In that sacrifice He gives other auspicious things like celestial body and power to the मुक्ताs which will be conducive to the service they are doing to भगवान् . This is like the master of a sacrifice who gives दक्षिण or fee to the priests who are officiating in it. Hence this name स्वस्ती-दक्षिण .

## 906 अरौद्रः

## 912 शब्दसहः
He who shoulders the burden of the words of cry of distress. With this name begins the episode of the relief given to गजेन्द्र . भगवान् hears and bears as a great burden the cry of animals for help even though the noise is indistinct. "He was again and again thinking of the devotion of the elephant."

## 913 शिशिरः
He who rushed to render help. As soon as He heard the cry of distress of the elephant, He flew with great haste to the place where the elephant was. Because of this speedy movement He is called 'Sisira'. The word 'sisira' is derived from the 'root' 'sasa' which signifies quick motion.

## 914 शर्वरीकरः
He who had the destructive weapons in His hands. (When He came for the rescue of Gajendra), the Lord had in His hands the five weapons which destroy the enemies who are a source of harm to others. (शर्वरी means destructive weapons.) The word 'शर्वरी ' is derived from the root 'sr' (to do harm), and the 'ष्वर्च ' affix has been added to it under the following rule. "The affix 'ष्वर्च' comes after 'kru', 'gru', 'sri' etc. The presence of 'ढa' at the beginning of the affix 'ष्वर्च' explains the addition of the affix 'ग्नीष् ' to denote the feminine gender. (Sri+ष्वर्च+ग्नीष्=शर्वरी ). The five weapons of the Lord are : Sankha, Chakra, गदा , सारंग (the bow) and Nandaka (the Sword).

## 915 अक्रूरः
He who is not cruel. Because of His desire to rescue the elephant, though भगवान् had all the weapons in His hands, He did not immediately cut the crocodile-अक्रूरः . Vide : "मधुसूदन , the Lord of inscrutable nature, quickly took out not only the elephant which had been seized by the corcodile, but lifted up the corcodile also from the waters of the tank." "The affix 'rak' comes after 'kruth' (to out) and the final 'tha' is changed in one case to 'cha', and in the other case 'क्रू ' replaces the whole root." (Kruth+च=क्रूर ).

## 916 पेशलः

The word दक्षिण is derived from the root 'दक्ष ' (to grow or act quickly). "The affix 'इणन् ' is added to the roots 'dru' and 'दक्षि '. 'Dru+इणन्=द्रविण ; दक्षि +इणन् =दक्षिणा ).

## 929 सन्तः
He who makes others prosper. In this way He confers prosperity on His devotees. "The affix 'da' is seen to come after other roots also." The force of 'api' is that this affix comes after verbs and other cases in composition with such verbs. Another meaning of Santhah is that भगवान् exists for His devotees. The use of the plural number as 'शान्तः ' (instead of 'san') is archaic. A third meaning is that He grants their desires. This is the past participle form of the verb 'शनोति ' (he bestows).

They along with प्रजापती were seeing all that with their eyes wide open with joy and dismay." In the पौष्कर (samhitha) it is said) : "He Who rescued गजेन्द्र from the crocodile is indeed the same Lord Who cuts asunder the bonds of संसार ."
