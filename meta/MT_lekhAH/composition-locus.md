rAmAyaNa mentions janapada significantly more frequently (per hemistich omitting uvAcha and UchuH lines) than mahAbhArata or harivaMsha. Mbh mentions rAShTra significantly more than R&H. nagara is nearly identical in R&H but marginally less in bhArata. Could this be reflection of the polities of the text redactors. The rAmAyaNa's janapada dominance might suggest an early eastern locus, while the rAShTra dominance in mahAbharata old kuru-pA~Nchala core where rAShTra was an important word. harivaMsha's state might also reflect the later time& sAtvatta locus.
