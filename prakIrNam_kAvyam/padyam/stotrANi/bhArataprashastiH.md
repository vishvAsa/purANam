**PREFATORY NOTE**

THE Inauguration and Proclamation of the Indian Republic on the 26th January 1950 is an event that is unique in the whole history of India. India was ruled by a foreign power from a foreign country for the first time during the ninteenth century and the first half of this century; till then India had entertained foreigners and some foreigners ruled parts of India also. But they ruled the country from within the country and as citizens of the country. The termination of this foreign rule, marked by the proclamation of the Republic is unique in so far as this is the first time when the whole of India was brought under a single administration. I have written this Ode to celebrate the occasion.

 I have no pretensions to being a poet; but I am second to none in my love for the country and in my pride for our traditions. Poetry is a very important factor in our traditions. All great events, all great personages, in the country have been immortalised by the poets of the times through poems written in their honour. I am simply following this great track, opened by our forefathers.

 It was Sardar K. M. Panikkar who suggested to me that I may write some verses in honour of this important occasion. I composed the verses and showed them to him; he approved. Dr. G. Srinivasa Murti, the Hon. Director of the Adyar Library, also gave his mark of approval. This is sufficient to make me bold to publish the Ode.

I. INDIA

 On this auspicious day, this India, freed from the chain of the supreme authority of foreigners cast on her legs by force, having suffered various humiliations for a century and a half, now has once more ascended to the honoured position of a Republic, worthy of herself, revered by all.

 India, that was herself a senior at the time when ancient civilizations like that of Egypt were born, and that grew virile when Greek, Roman and other Empires were prospering and collapsing, even remains triumphant, full of youth and happy, when modern countries like England are growing old.

 To save the intelligent men of this world who are craving for material gains and who, though in themselves intensely devoted to virtue, turn back their face from spiritual glory through delusions, like people who are tossed about on the multitude of waves in the ocean after a ship-wreck, India alone has the ability with the boat of wisdom.

 The birth-place of holy personages like Jina and Buddha who are Teachers of Religions, the fountain of wisdom, the centre for the spread of that (wisdom) in the whole world, a permanent homeland of peace for the followers of the Islamic, Christian and Jewish Religions, may this country that gave shelter to the followers of the Parsi Religion, shine for ever.

 The city that was far-famed for prosperity in the Mahabharata as Indraprastha, now glows in this world as the New Delhi, the Capital City of India, having very beautiful gardens, shops, brilliant lights, big streets, tanks, columns and mansions.

**II. THE PRESIDENT**

 There shines in the City of Delhi, the first President elected by the people through their representatives according to their free choice, who is well-known as Rajen Babu, an ocean of benevolence, endowed with all the good qualities of a ruler of rulers (Rajendra), bearing the name of Rajendra with the by-name of Prasad, having a radiant face from which proceed graceful (Prasada) looks.

 Formerly the Province of Bihar was subjected to a great Earthquake, and to give protection to all the people who lost their wealth and whose houses were destroyed and who were left destitute thereby, he collected a large amount of money and rendered them suitable help. This praiseworthy incident is even now sung about by the children there.

 This Rajendra, having risen to the position of being the leader of the whole country which was befitting of his grandeur, and later becoming himself the President of the Constituent Assembly of India, made his own country a Sovereign, Democratic Republic through a Law, the performer of good deeds.

 His scholarship in the multitude of political science is, indeed, saturated with the essence of literary accomplishments; in him the steady determination to stick to Truth is completely free from all motives for the attainment of personal ends; his attachment to the maintenance of the chains of ancient traditions is pure; it looks as if he is the Dharma ofIndia itself, bearing a body.

 He, having taken his place in the forefront in the great battle called Satyagraha that lasted for a very long period in this country, for the purpose of winning freedom for their own (land), he suffered ill-health, separation from a large number of relatives and friends, and humiliation in prison. In course of time, he attained the fruit in the form of becoming the First Citizen of India.

III\. THE PRIME MINISTER

 Here is the great Prime Minister, with a serene heart, who through his share grandeur, destroys the impetuosity (Jawa-hara) of persons who are engaged in bringing misery to the country, who entertains (Lalayan) those who are in childhood; to him, his father, who could know the real truth, gave the charming name of Jawahara followed by Lal, which is literally true, adorned with the by-name of Nehru.

 The saintly Motilal, by whom various kinds of knowledge were acquired as a boy, then later in youth, great wealth was amassed proceeding strictly along paths of virtue, and in old age again, his property was given away for the benefit of India, he bearing the by-name of Nehru, is his father, indeed.

 Although he spends much of his time manifesting his literary talents by producing books on excellent subjects, that are praised in the whole world, by addressing assemblies of good people, and by writing various articles, he still bears the entire burden of the government of India, without dependence on anyone else.

 Living in mansions surrounded by a variety of luxuries or in a prison, lauded in all the three worlds or vilified by evil minded people everywhere, enticed by material pleasures or surrounded on all sides by dangers, the brave hero never allows his heart to undergo any modification.

 Proficiency in the paths of diplomacy, the spreading fame that surpasses the whole world, extreme courtesy to his own countrymen, feeling of being just a brother even to the lowliest, intellect awake to the needs of the times, in matters conducive to the good of the country: in this way, there abide in him all the qualities of a leader of his country, unseen in any other person.

IV\. DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER

 In taming the enemies who rush forward like a maddened elephant, a lion of terrible looks, to those who revel in pleasures (or serpents) after exploiting the good people, a magic spell that never fails in its effect, in crushing the rulers of the country who have dropped down from the paths of justice, a Parasurama: such a hero, Patel, now occupies the position of Deputy Prime Minister, here.

 His grandeur is such that no one can resist him; his valour is such that the whole world trembles before it; his calmness is such that he is freely accessible; his supremely transparent fame is such that it is being sung about everywhere.

 Firm in nature, he does not frequently stir out of his own residence; his intentions, being very subtle, cannot even be inferred from his behaviour; his words spoken by him are not available in plenty to hear in this world. But he is felt everywhere on account of his grandeur and on account of the achievements of the results.

 In all his undertakings, the obstacles run away by themselves suddenly through fear of him, as the morning dew melts when the sun rises. But all achievements ever fall at his feet with a gratified heart, being delighted to serve a person of such lordly powers.

 Not merely in name, but also through his benevolence, he is the favourite (Vallabha) of the world; though he occupies the elevated position of being a Sardar acquired through family heritage, he bears a feeling of equality not at all different from that of a brother, in full and without qualification even towards the peasants living in the villages. Does he not thus remain the greatest of all?
