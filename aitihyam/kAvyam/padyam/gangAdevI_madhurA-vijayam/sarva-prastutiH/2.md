Slender,  
no more oppressed by ornaments,  
her round face reed-pale,  
the Queen resembled a river run to a trickle in Śarad,  
no longer blanketed in day-blossoming lotus blooms,  
harbouring the orbed moon  
as night draws near.

‘The earth for a chariot;  
Brahmā himself the charioteer.  
The king of snakes serving as bowstring,  
and Mount Meru his bow.  
And, so they say,  
no less than Śauri[^1] as his shaft.  
To fight whom?  
A mere triad of cities!’

conqueror of the three cities.[^2]

He bore the hairy sign of Śrīvatsa on his breast which suggested that he was an avatāra of Viṣnu, and, that unbroken prosperity would mark his life. His forehead was adorned with a circle of hair between the eye-brows. His eyes were large like the petals of blooming lotus. His nose was lofty; and a sweet smile played on his red lips.

so the King shone with his three sons[^4].
