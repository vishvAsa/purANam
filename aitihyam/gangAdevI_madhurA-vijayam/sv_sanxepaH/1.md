<details><summary>Shankar & Venetia</summary>

To the goddess of speech,  
Sarasvatī,  
do I bow –  
a *śārikā* in the bejewelled birdcages  
of the best bards’ lotus mouths,  
the moonlight  
rousing the ocean of human consciousness.

<details><summary>Shankar & Venetia</summary>

A poem may be sound,   
but unless sweet  
it will not delight the literati.  
A wife may be faithful,  
but unless pretty  
she will not please her spouse.

A man of taste needs no encouragement

There lived a king  
named Bukkarāja,   
the younger brother of Harihara.  
Brave kings from each border  
with heads bent consented to his every order.

Roiling the whole host of hostile kings,  
vast as the ocean,  
with the mountain of his globe-bearing arm –  
child’s play for him –  
he produced his own *amṛta*, fame.[^1]

[^1]: The King’s arm is here compared to Mount Mandara which was used to churn the ocean to produce *amṛta*.

The very kings who had opposed him
