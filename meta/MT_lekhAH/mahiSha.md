Image of nIlalohita rudra holding the corpse of the buffalo-demon hAlAhala from ahichChatra. The kShetra of the rudra is however the holy kurukShetra. There are 3 buffalo demons in H tradition: 

1. The oldest is mahiSha slain by skanda; 
2. mahiSha slain by kumArI vindhyavAsinI 
3. hAlAhala slain by nIlalohita rudra. 


Briefly, the goddess who slays mahiSha in the archaic skandapurANa is vindhyavAsinI-kumarI-kaushikI; In the mArkaNDeyapurANa it is durgA-mahAlakshmI. A more elaborate account of this development would need a lot more space.

## Tale of kurukShetra
The archaic skandapurANa provides that +++(hAlAhala's)+++ tale.

Even as the 5th head of brahman uttered the incantation:

> कापालिन् रुद्र बभ्रो ऽथ  
> भव कैरात सुव्रत।  
> पाहि विश्वं विशालाक्ष  
> कुमारवरविक्रम॥  

(nIlalohita rudra desiring to furnish himself with a skull)  

... he is said to have placed this skull at kurukShetra and his gaNa's raised a great uproar. 

The asura-s led by the buffalo demon hAlAhala then challenged them & were killed by the rudra's retinue. Then nIlalohita offered the flesh of the buffalo demon a feast for a bevy of ferocious goddesses known as the kapAlamAtR^i-s who were installed at that kShetra which became a cremation ground. siddha-s were said to perform their rites in the said cemetery.
   

## Pics
gupta sealing from kapAlakShetra, most likely from the spot of the cemetery. The image of the goddess is flanked by a trishUla & a chakra. Hence, Manoj Kumar who reported this find said that it was a "female" version of harihara but that's dubious. Attributes are typical of durgA.
