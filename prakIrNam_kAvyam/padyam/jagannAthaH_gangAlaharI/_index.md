When Parvati, mother of Ganesha cast her glance, which imitated the glow of the rising sun, at Ganga who was (caught) in the locks of Siva’s head, Ganga’s turmoil took the form of high waves emanating from the head of Siva. May those waves destroy your sinful world.

_(When Bhagiratha wanted to bring Ganga to the world to sanctify the ashes of his forefathers, Ganga fell on the locks of hair of Siva and could not get out of it. The poet imagines that Parvati jealous of Ganga looked at her with anger and the turmoil of Ganga that ensued has caused the high waves of Ganga._)

May the waves of Ganga which are performing a _tandava_ dance remove my distress. When Siva dances at nightfall his locks of hair swing and Ganga caught in the locks comes out shaking as if in a _tandava_ dance. Water streams around the center of (Siva’s) throat sound as if a _damaru_ is being played.

When your waves spilled out from the matted hairs of Siva, whose half of the body was that of his beloved, Parvati who was your rival warded them off with her tender hands while her looks showed annoyance. Mother, may those waves flourish. [ _Siva was अर्धनारीश्वर and therefore waves of Ganga affected Parvati too, who considered Ganga her rival_]

The poet is no ordinary sinner and Ganga has to take special efforts to raise him up!_)

You are as white as the moon in autumn. Your crown is resplendent with the crescent moon. You carry two pot-like lotuses and two _abhayamudras_ in your hands.

She has four hands [करैः is plural]. Two hands convey _abhayamudra_ [वर-भयनिरासौ]. Two hands carry two large lotuses [कुम्भाम्भोजे].Note: It is possible that I have not grasped the purport of the poet, although I have tried my best to decipher what he wants to convey. Is there any specific human form traditionally given to Ganga? Why is Ganga on a मकर? The Sanskrit commentary has not been of much help. Help from readers is welcome. What exactly is मकर is not clear, although it is a fairly common word. Is it crocodile or shark or some other animal? )

<details><summary>Intro (GSS Murthy)</summary>



Jagannatha Pandita who lived during the reign of emperor Shahajehan (1592-1666) in Delhi for several years under his patronage was a Telugu Brahmin whose father Perubhatta was an erudite scholar. Jagannatha, endowed with sharp intellect, acquired deep knowledge in various fields of learning under the tutelage of his father. It is said that he first went to Tanjore to establish himself. But failing in his effort he moved North ultimately landing in Delhi where Shahjehan recognized his merit and offered him his patronage. His fame spread far and wide.

A story goes that young Jagannatha fell in love with a Muslim girl –emperor’s daughter- and married her.

He has authored a number of well known works, the most famous of which is “Rasagangadhara”- a treatise on poetics. He was also a contemporary of Appayaadikshita, author of “Kuvalayananda”- again an authoritative work on Figures of speech. Appayyadikshita was Jagannatha Pandita’s literary rival and he severely criticized Appayyadikshita in his work.

There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, connecting these two great authors. Jagannatha who was old then was sleeping on the banks of Ganga with his Muslim wife when Appayyadikshita came there for a bath. Inadvertently Appayyadikshita stepped on Jagannatha and exclaimed

“किं निश्शङ्कं शेषे शेषेवयसि त्वमागते मृत्यौ”

“Why are you sleeping without any care when Death is knocking at your doors?”

Quickly he recognized Jagannatha and said

“अथवा सुखं शयीथाः निकटे जागर्ति जाह्नवी भवतः”

“Or do sleep comfortably. Ganga is awake by your side.”

Jagannatha wrote “Gangalahari” eulogizing Ganga perhaps to expiate for his sin of marrying a Muslim woman. It has 52 verses and it is said that as he recited verse after verse Ganga rose up steadily one step for a verse and on the 52<sup>nd</sup> verse Ganga touched Jagannatha washing away his sins.

Now let us get to know this fine piece of poetry. I have taken guidance from the Sanskrit commentary on Gangalahari authored by Late. K N Varadaraja Iyengar.
