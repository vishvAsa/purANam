Introduction, transliteration, and translation by  
Devendraray V . Bhatt and S . V . Ganesan  

Introduction:    
  
The Shiva Mahimna Stotra is very popular among the devotees of Lord Shiva  
and is considered one of the best among all Stotras (or Stutis) offered to  
Lord Shiva . The legend about the circumstances leading to the composition  
of this Stotra is as follows.  
  
A king named Chitraratha had constructed a nice garden . There were  
beautiful flowers in this garden . These flowers were used every day by the  
king in worshipping Lord Shiva.  
  
One day a Gandharva (Singer in the court of Indra, the Lord of the Heaven)  
named PuShpadanta being fascinated by the beautiful flowers, began to steal  
them, as a consequence of which king Chitraratha could not offer flowers to  
Lord Shiva . He tried very hard to capture the thief, but in vain, because  
the Gandharvas have divine power to remain invisible.  
  
Finally the king spread the Shiva NirmAlya  in his garden . Shiva  
NirmAlya  consists of the Bilva leaves, flowers, et cetera which  
have been used in worshipping Lord Shiva . The Shiva NirmAlya is  
considered holy.  
The thief PuShpadanta, not knowing this, walked on the Shiva NirmAlya,  
and by that he incurred the wrath of Lord Shiva and lost the divine power  
of invisibility . He then designed a prayer to Lord Shiva for forgiveness.  
In this prayer he sung the greatness of the Lord.  
  
This very prayer became well known as the `Shiva Mahimna Stotra'.  
Lord Shiva became pleased by this StotraM, and returned PuShpadanta's  
divine powers.  
  
The legend has some basis since the name of the author is mentioned  
in verse number 38 of the stotraM . The recital of this stotra is very  
beneficial,  
and Shri Ramakrishna, one of the famous saints of the nineteenth century,  
went into samadhi just by reciting a few verses from this hymn.  
  
Let its recitation be beneficial to you as well!

Thus ends the `shivamahimna hymn' composed by PuShpadanta.

In some texts, following verses are included as starting ones.

॥ अथ श्री शिवमहिम्नस्तोत्रम् ॥  
  
महिम्नः पारं ते परमविदुषो यद्यसदृशी  
स्तुतिर्ब्रह्मादीनामपि तदवसन्नास्त्वयि गिरः ।  
अथाऽवाच्यः सर्वः स्वमतिपरिणामावधि गृणन्  
ममाप्येष स्तोत्रे हर निरपवादः परिकरः ॥ १॥  
  
  
O, Lord Shiva, remover of all types of miseries, what wonder is there, if  
the prayer to you, chanted by one who is ignorant about your greatness, is  
worthless! Because, even the utterance ( speech ) of BrahmA and other gods  
is not able to fathom your merits ( ie, greatness ).  
Hence, if persons with  
very limited intellect ( and I am one of them ) try to offer you a prayer,  
their attempt deserve your special favour . If it is so, I should not be a  
exception . Hence, (thinking like this ) I begin this prayer . (1)  
  
अतीतः पन्थानं तव च महिमा वाङ्मनसयोः  
अतद्व्यावृत्त्या यं चकितमभिधत्ते श्रुतिरपि ।  
स कस्य स्तोतव्यः कतिविधगुणः कस्य विषयः  
पदे त्वर्वाचीने पतति न मनः कस्य न वचः ॥ २॥  
  
  
O, Great God, so great is your majesty that it cannot be reached by speech  
and mind . Even the Vedas also, having become surprised, confirm your  
greatness by only saying `Neti', `Neti' (not this, not this) while  
describing you . Who can praise this type of greatness of yours? With how  
many qualities is it composed? Whose subject of description can it be ? And  
yet even then whose mind and speech are not attached to your this new  
Saguna form ?                              (2)  
  
मधुस्फीता वाचः परमममृतं निर्मितवतः  
तव ब्रह्मन् किं वागपि सुरगुरोर्विस्मयपदम् ।  
मम त्वेतां वाणीं गुणकथनपुण्येन भवतः  
पुनामीत्यर्थेऽस्मिन् पुरमथन बुद्धिर्व्यवसिता ॥ ३॥  
  
  
O, ParamAtmA (Greatest Soul), as you are the very creator of speech of  
the Vedas, which is like highest type of nectar and as sweet as honey, how  
can even the speech of Brahaspati (Guru, or spiritual guide of gods)  
surprise you ? (ie, the speech of even Brahaspati is worthless before you).  
O, Destroyer of Three Cities of the demons, thinking that my speech may  
become purified by this act, my intellect (Buddhi) has become prepared to  
sing your greatness .                              (3)  
  
तवैश्वर्यं यत्तज्जगदुदयरक्षाप्रलयकृत्  
त्रयीवस्तु व्यस्तं तिस्रुषु गुणभिन्नासु तनुषु ।  
अभव्यानामस्मिन् वरद रमणीयामरमणीं  
विहन्तुं व्याक्रोशीं विदधत इहैके जडधियः ॥ ४॥  
  
  
O, Giver of Boons, your greatness is the cause of creation, maintenance,  
and destruction of the whole universe; this is supported by three Vedas  
(ie, Rigveda, Yajurveda, and SAmaveda); it is distributed in the three  
qualities (ie, Satva, Rajas and Tamas) and three bodies (of BrahmA, ViShNu  
and Mahesha). Such is your greatness but certain stupid persons in this  
world are trying to destroy it by slander, which may be delightful to them  
but is really undelightful .                              (4)  
  
किमीहः किङ्कायः स खलु किमुपायस्त्रिभुवनं  
किमाधारो धाता सृजति किमुपादान इति च ।  
अतर्क्यैश्वर्ये त्वय्यनवसर दुःस्थो हतधियः  
कुतर्कोऽयं कांश्चित् मुखरयति मोहाय जगतः ॥ ५॥  
  
  
If the ParamAtmA (the Greatest Soul) creates the three worlds (ie, the  
whole Universe), what is his gesture ? What is his body ? What is his plan  
? What is his basis (support)? What are his means (instruments,resources) ?  
These are the useless questions raised by some stupid critics, in order to  
mislead people, against one (i.e., you) who always remains incompatible to  
senses .                              (5)  
  
अजन्मानो लोकाः किमवयववन्तोऽपि जगतां  
अधिष्ठातारं किं भवविधिरनादृत्य भवति ।  
अनीशो वा कुर्याद् भुवनजनने कः परिकरो  
यतो मन्दास्त्वां प्रत्यमरवर संशेरत इमे ॥ ६॥  
  
  
O, Best Of The Gods, are the seven Lokas (It is believed that there are  
seven worlds in this Universe,  namely, Bhooloka, Bhuvarloka, Svargaloka,  
Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapaloka, and Satyaloka) unborn ? Was the birth of  
the Universe independent of its Lord (ie, You) ? If it was so, then what  
were the means by which it was created that the stupid critics are creating  
doubts about you? (ie, you are the only creater of the whole  
Universe).                              (6)  
  
त्रयी साङ्ख्यं योगः पशुपतिमतं वैष्णवमिति  
प्रभिन्ने प्रस्थाने परमिदमदः पथ्यमिति च ।  
रुचीनां वैचित्र्यादृजुकुटिल नानापथजुषां  
नृणामेको गम्यस्त्वमसि पयसामर्णव इव ॥ ७॥  
  
  
The different practices based on the three Vedas, SaMkhya, Yoga,  
Pashupata-mata, VaiShNava-mata etc . are but different paths (to  
reach to the Greatest Truth) and people on account of their different  
aptitude choose from them whatever they think best and deserved to be  
accepted . But as the sea is the final resting place for all types of  
streams , You are the only reaching place  for all people whichever  
path,straight or zigzag, they may accept .                         (7)  
  
महोक्षः खट्वाङ्गं परशुरजिनं भस्म फणिनः

सुरास्तां तामृद्धिं दधति तु भवद्भूप्रणिहितां  
न हि स्वात्मारामं विषयमृगतृष्णा भ्रमयति ॥ ८॥  
  
  
O, Giver of the Boons, the bull, the parts of a cot, chisel, the  
elephant-skin, Ashes, the serpent, the skull : these are the articles of  
your house-hold . And yet gods get all their riches merely by the movement  
of your eye-brows . Really, false desires for worldly things do  
not deceive (mislead) one who is always is absorbed in  
his soul ( ie, the Yogi- in fact You ).                              (8)  
  
ध्रुवं कश्चित् सर्वं सकलमपरस्त्वध्रुवमिदं

समस्तेऽप्येतस्मिन् पुरमथन तैर्विस्मित इव  
स्तुवन् जिह्रेमि त्वां न खलु ननु धृष्टा मुखरता ॥ ९॥  
  
  
O, Destroyer Of  ( Three ) Cities, some persons call this Universe eternal  
( ever lasting), others call it temporary, and yet others call it both  
eternal and temporary . Hence, being surprised ( perplexed ) by  these  
contradictory opinions on this subject, I am really becoming immodest in  
loquaciously praising You .                              (9)  
  
तवैश्वर्यं यत्नाद् यदुपरि विरिञ्चिर्हरिरधः  
परिच्छेतुं यातावनिलमनलस्कन्धवपुषः ।  
ततो भक्तिश्रद्धा-भरगुरु-गृणद्भ्यां गिरिश यत्  
स्वयं तस्थे ताभ्यां तव किमनुवृत्तिर्न फलति ॥ १०॥  
  
  
Brahma and ViShNu wanted to measure your wealth i.e.greatness . You took  
the form of Fire and your whole body was a column of fire extending over  
space . While Brahma took the form of a swan and flew high to see the  
top(head), ViShNu took the form of a boar and dug up downwards to see the  
bottom (feet).Neither could succeed.(While ViShNu confessed the truth,  
Brahma falsely claimed that he had found the top and persuaded the Ketaki  
flower to bear false witness.Shiva punished Brahma by removing one of his 5  
heads and ordered that henceforth the Ketaki flower should not be used for  
his worship).When ultimately both praised you with full devotion and faith,  
you stood before them revealing your normal form . O, mountain-dweller, does  
not toeing your line always bear fruit?                              (10)  
  
अयत्नादासाद्य त्रिभुवनमवैरव्यतिकरं

शिरःपद्मश्रेणी-रचितचरणाम्भोरुह-बलेः  
स्थिरायास्त्वद्भक्तेस्त्रिपुरहर विस्फूर्जितमिदम् ॥ ११॥  
  
  
Oh,destroyer of the three cities! The effortless achievement of the  
ten-headed Ravana in  making the  three worlds enemyless( having conquered)  
and his arrant eagerness for further fight by stretching his arms,are but  
the result of his constant devotion to your lotus feet at which he ever  
laid the lotus garland consisting of his 10 heads!              (11)  
  
अमुष्य त्वत्सेवा-समधिगतसारं भुजवनं  
बलात् कैलासेऽपि त्वदधिवसतौ विक्रमयतः ।  
अलभ्यापातालेऽप्यलसचलिताङ्गुष्ठशिरसि  
प्रतिष्ठा त्वय्यासीद् ध्रुवमुपचितो मुह्यति खलः ॥ १२॥  
  
  
Having obtained all his prowess through worshipping you, RavaNa once dared  
to test the  power of his arms  at your own dwelling place(Kailas  
Mountain). When he tried to lift it up, you just moved a toe of your foot  
on a head of his  and lo! Ravana could not find rest or peace even in the  
nether-world . Surely, power maddens the wicked . Finally RavaNa  
reestablished his faith in you .                              (12)  
  
यदृद्धिं सुत्राम्णो वरद परमोच्चैरपि सतीं  
अधश्चक्रे बाणः परिजनविधेयत्रिभुवनः ।  
न तच्चित्रं तस्मिन् वरिवसितरि त्वच्चरणयोः  
न कस्याप्युन्नत्यै भवति शिरसस्त्वय्यवनतिः ॥ १३॥  
  
  
Oh boon-giver! BANa, the demon king made all the three worlds serve him  
with all their attendants and even the greatest wealth of Indra was a  
trifle for him . It was not a surprise at all, since he `dwelt' in your  
feet; who does not rise in life by bowing his head to you?      (13)  
  
अकाण्ड-ब्रह्माण्ड-क्षयचकित-देवासुरकृपा  
विधेयस्याऽऽसीद् यस्त्रिनयन विषं संहृतवतः ।  
स कल्माषः कण्ठे तव न कुरुते न श्रियमहो  
विकारोऽपि श्लाघ्यो भुवन-भय- भङ्ग- व्यसनिनः ॥ १४॥  
  
  
When the ocean was being churned by the gods and demons for  
`amRit'(nectar),various objects came forth: at one point, there emerged  
the `kAlakUTa' poison which threatened to consume everything . The gods as  
well as the demons were stunned at the prospect of the entire universe  
coming to an end, O, three-eyed lord, who is ever compassionate and engaged  
in removing the fear of the world, you took it(poison) on yourself by  
consuming it . (On Parvati's holding Shiva's throat at that point, the  
poison froze blue there itself and Shiva became `neelakaNTha'). It is  
strange that this stain in your neck, though appearing to be a deformity,  
actually adds to your richness and personality .                (14)  
  
असिद्धार्था नैव क्वचिदपि सदेवासुरनरे  
निवर्तन्ते नित्यं जगति जयिनो यस्य विशिखाः ।  
स पश्यन्नीश त्वामितरसुरसाधारणमभूत्  
स्मरः स्मर्तव्यात्मा न हि वशिषु पथ्यः परिभवः ॥ १५॥  
  
  
The cupid's(love-god `manmatha's) (flower) arrows never return  
unaccomplished whether the victims were gods or demons or men . However O,  
master! he has now become just a remembered soul (without body),since he  
looked upon you as any other ordinary god, shot his arrow and got burnt to  
ashes,in no time . Insulting, masters (who have controlled their senses),  
does one no good .                              (15)  
  
मही पादाघाताद् व्रजति सहसा संशयपदं

जगद्रक्षायै त्वं नटसि ननु वामैव विभुता ॥ १६॥  
  
  
You dance for protecting the world, but strangely, your glorious act  
appears to produce the opposite result in that the earth suddenly struck by  
your dancing feet doubts that it is coming to an end; even ViShNu's domain  
is shaken in fear when your mace like arms bruise the planets; the godly  
region feels miserable when its banks are struck by your agitated matted  
locks (of hair)!                              (16)  
  
वियद्व्यापी तारा-गण-गुणित-फेनोद्गम-रुचिः

अनेनैवोन्नेयं धृतमहिम दिव्यं तव वपुः ॥ १७॥  
  
  
The divine river flows extensively through the sky and its charm is  
enhanced by the illumination of the foam by the groups of stars . (Brought  
down to the earth by the King Bhagiratha by propitiating Lord Shiva and  
known as Ganga) it creates many islands and whirlpools on the earth . The  
same turbulent river appears like a mere droplet of water on your head.  
This itself shows how lofty and divine your body(form) is!      (17)  
  
रथः क्षोणी यन्ता शतधृतिरगेन्द्रो धनुरथो  
रथाङ्गे चन्द्रार्कौ रथ-चरण-पाणिः शर इति ।  
दिधक्षोस्ते कोऽयं त्रिपुरतृणमाडम्बर विधिः  
विधेयैः क्रीडन्त्यो न खलु परतन्त्राः प्रभुधियः ॥ १८॥  
  
  
When you wanted to burn the three cities, you had the earth as the chariot,  
Brahma as the charioteer,the Meru mountain as the bow, the sun and the moon  
as the parts of the chariot and ViShNu  himself(who holds the  
chariot-wheeel in his hand -Sudarshan chakra?), as the arrow . Why this  
demonstrative show when you as the dictator of everything, could have done  
the job as a trifle? The Lord's greatness is not dependent on anybody or  
anything . ( Incidentally there is a view  that the burning of the three  
cities  would refer to the burning of three kinds of bodies of man i.e.  
`sthUla sharIra', `sUkShma sharIra' and `kAraNa sharIra').      (18)  
  
हरिस्ते साहस्रं कमल बलिमाधाय पदयोः

गतो भक्त्युद्रेकः परिणतिमसौ चक्रवपुषः  
त्रयाणां रक्षायै त्रिपुरहर  जागर्ति जगताम् ॥ १९॥  
  
  
ViShNu once brought 1000 lotuses and  was placing them at your feet;  
after placing 999 flowers he found that one was missing; he plucked out one  
of his own eyes and offered it as a lotus; this supreme exemplification of  
devotion on his part was transformed into the wheel (sudarshana chakra) in  
his hand, which he uses for protecting the world .              (19)  
  
क्रतौ सुप्ते जाग्रत् त्वमसि फलयोगे क्रतुमतां  
क्व कर्म प्रध्वस्तं फलति पुरुषाराधनमृते ।  
अतस्त्वां सम्प्रेक्ष्य क्रतुषु फलदान-प्रतिभुवं  
श्रुतौ श्रद्धां बध्वा दृढपरिकरः कर्मसु जनः ॥ २०॥  
  
  
You ensure that there is a connection between cause and effect and hence  
when   men perform a sacrifice they obtain good results . Otherwise how can  
there be future result for a past action? Thus on seeing your power in  
rewarding people performing sacrificial worship, with good results, men  
believe in Vedas and  firmly engage themselves in various  
worshipful acts .                              (20)  
  
क्रियादक्षो दक्षः क्रतुपतिरधीशस्तनुभृतां

क्रतुभ्रंशस्त्वत्तः क्रतुफल-विधान-व्यसनिनः  
ध्रुवं कर्तुं श्रद्धा विधुरमभिचाराय हि मखाः ॥ २१॥  
  
  
All the same,O Protector . though you exert to reward all sacrifices . those  
done without faith in you become counter-productive, as exemplified in the  
case of the sacrifice performed by DakSha; DakSha was well-versed in the  
art of sacrifices  and himself the Lord of Creation; besides, he was the  
chief performer: the great maharishis were the priests and the various gods  
were the participants! (DakSha did not invite Shiva and insulted him  
greatly; thus enraged, Shiva destroyed the sacrifice and DakSha too). (21)  
  
प्रजानाथं नाथ प्रसभमभिकं स्वां दुहितरं

O, Protector! Once Brahma became infatuated with his own daughter .  
When she fled taking the form of a female deer he also took the  
form of a male deer and chased her . You took the form of a hunter  
and went after him, with a bow in hand . Struck by your arrow and  
very much frightened, Brahma fled to the sky taking the form of a  
star . Even today he stands frightened by you .              (22)

अवैति त्वामद्धा बत वरद मुग्धा युवतयः ॥ २३॥  
  
  
O, destroyer of the three cities! Boon-giver! Practitioner of  
austerities!  Before the very eyes of Parvati, you reduced  
Manmatha (the god of love) to ashes,the moment he tried to  
arouse passion in you for Parvati, by shooting his famous  
flower arrows . Even after witnessing this, if Parvati, thinks  
that you are attracted by her physical charm, on the basis of  
your sharing half the body with her, certainly women are  
under self- delusion .                              (23)  
  
श्मशानेष्वाक्रीडा स्मरहर पिशाचाः सहचराः  
चिता-भस्मालेपः स्रगपि नृकरोटी-परिकरः ।  
अमङ्गल्यं शीलं तव भवतु नामैवमखिलं  
तथापि स्मर्तॄणां वरद परमं मङ्गलमसि ॥ २४॥  
  
  
O,boon giver! O,destroyer of Cupid! You play  in the burning ghats . your  
friends are the ghosts . Your body is smeared with the ashes of the dead  
bodies . Your  garland is of human skulls . Every aspect of your character is  
thus inauspicious . Let it be . It does not matter . Because, with all these  
known oddness, you are quick to grant all auspicious things to the people  
who just think of you . (It is interesting to note here that in his Devi  
aparAdha kShamApana stotra  Shankaracharya says that,despite his poor and  
deficient possessions,Shiva got the power to grant boons entirely because  
because of his having taken the hand of Parvathi in marriage; in the  
previous shloka, PuShpadanta calls it naive on the part of Parvati, if she  
thinks that Shiva is attracted by her charm simply because he is sharing  
half the body with her.This dichotomy etc . is due to the custom that when a  
particular lord is to be extolled, the other gods are to be belittled to  
some extent).                              (24)  
  
मनः प्रत्यक् चित्ते सविधमविधायात्त-मरुतः

यदालोक्याह्लादं ह्रद इव निमज्यामृतमये  
दधत्यन्तस्तत्त्वं किमपि यमिनस्तत् किल भवान् ॥ २५॥  
  
  
The great yogis regulate their breath, control and still their mind, look  
inward and enjoy the bliss with their hair standing on edge and eyes filled  
with tears of joy . It looks as though they are immersed in nectar . That  
bliss which they see in their heart and exult thus, is verily  
you Yourself!                              (25)  
(The second line has an alternate (pAThabheda),  
salilotsa.ngita (salila + utsa.ngita).  
However, utsa.ngati is more appropriate than sa.ngita,  
both in terms of meaning and grammar!  
sa.ngita has grammatical problems (it needs to be  
sa.ngIta which does not fit the meter! It may as well  
be some printer's mistake originally which got  
reprinted in newer books.)  
  
त्वमर्कस्त्वं सोमस्त्वमसि पवनस्त्वं हुतवहः

परिच्छिन्नामेवं त्वयि परिणता बिभ्रति गिरं  
न विद्मस्तत्तत्त्वं वयमिह तु यत् त्वं न भवसि ॥ २६॥  
  
  
You are the sun, the moon, the air, the fire, the water, the  
sky(ether/space), and the earth (the five elements or `bhUtA's). You are  
the Self which is omnipresent . Thus people describe in words every  
attribute as yours . On the other hand, I do not know any fundamental  
principle or thing or substance, which you are not!        (26)  
  
त्रयीं तिस्रो वृत्तीस्त्रिभुवनमथो त्रीनपि सुरान्  
अकाराद्यैर्वर्णैस्त्रिभिरभिदधत् तीर्णविकृति ।  
तुरीयं ते धाम ध्वनिभिरवरुन्धानमणुभिः  
समस्त-व्यस्तं त्वां शरणद गृणात्योमिति पदम् ॥ २७॥  
  
  
O, grantor of refuge and protection! The word `OM' consists of the three  
letters `a', `u' and `m'. It refers to the three Vedas(Rik, YajuH and  
SAma), the three states (JAgrat, Swapna, and suShupti-awakened,  
dreaming and sleeping),the three worlds(BhUH, bhuvaH and suvaH) and the  
three gods (Brahma, ViShNu amd Mahesha).It refers to you yourself both  
through the individual letters as well as collectively; in the latter form  
(i.e . the total word `OM') it refers to your omnipresent absolute nature,  
as the fourth state of existence i.e `turIyaM' (sleep-like yet awakened and  
alert state, as a fully- drawn bow).                              (27)  
  
भवः शर्वो रुद्रः पशुपतिरथोग्रः सहमहान्  
तथा भीमेशानाविति यदभिधानाष्टकमिदम् ।  
अमुष्मिन् प्रत्येकं प्रविचरति देव श्रुतिरपि  
प्रियायास्मैधाम्ने प्रणिहित-नमस्योऽस्मि भवते ॥ २८॥  
  
  
I salute you as the dear abode of the following 8 names:bhava,  
sharva, rudra, pashupati, ugra, sahamahAn, bhIma, and IshAna;  
the `Vedas' also discusses individually about these names .       (28)  
(Also a variation of first and second lines as sahamahAnstathA.)  
  
नमो नेदिष्ठाय प्रियदव दविष्ठाय च नमः  
नमः क्षोदिष्ठाय स्मरहर महिष्ठाय च नमः ।  
नमो वर्षिष्ठाय त्रिनयन यविष्ठाय च नमः  
नमः सर्वस्मै ते तदिदमतिसर्वाय च नमः ॥ २९॥  
  
  
O, destroyer of Cupid! O, the three-eyed one! Salutations to you, who is  
the forest-lover, the nearest and the farthest; the minutest and the  
biggest, the oldest and the youngest; salutations to you who is everything  
and beyond everything!                              (29)  
  
बहुल-रजसे विश्वोत्पत्तौ भवाय नमो नमः  
प्रबल-तमसे तत् संहारे हराय नमो नमः ।  
जन-सुखकृते सत्त्वोद्रिक्तौ मृडाय नमो नमः  
प्रमहसि पदे निस्त्रैगुण्ये शिवाय नमो नमः ॥ ३०॥  
  
  
Salutations to you in the name of'Bhava' in as much as you create the world by  
taking the `rajas' as the dominant quality; salutations to you in the name  
of `Hara' in as much as you destroy the world by taking the `tamas' as the  
dominant quality; salutations to you in the name of `MRiDa', in as much as  
you maintain and protect the world by taking `satva' as the dominant  
quality . Again salutations to you in the name of Shiva in as much as you are  
beyond the above-mentioned three qualities and are the seat of the supreme  
bliss .                              (30)

वपुष्प्रादुर्भावादनुतमितदं जन्मनि पुरा  
पुरारे! नैवाहं क्वचिदपि भवन्तं प्रणतवान् ।  
नमन्मुक्तः सम्प्रत्यतनुरहमग्रेप्यनतिमान्  
महेश! क्षन्तव्यं तदिदमपराधद्वयमपि ॥ ३०-१ ॥



कृश-परिणति-चेतः क्लेशवश्यं क्व चेदं  
क्व च तव गुण-सीमोल्लङ्घिनी शश्वदृद्धिः ।  
इति चकितममन्दीकृत्य मां भक्तिराधाद्  
वरद चरणयोस्ते वाक्य-पुष्पोपहारम् ॥ ३१॥  
  
  
O, boon-giver! I was very perplexed to sing your praise considering my  
little awareness and afflicted mind vis-a-vis your ever increasing  
limitless quality; however, my devotion to you made me set aside this  
diffidence and place these floral lines at your feet .            (31)  
  
असित-गिरि-समं स्यात् कज्जलं सिन्धु-पात्रे  
सुर-तरुवर-शाखा लेखनी पत्रमुर्वी ।  
लिखति यदि गृहीत्वा शारदा सर्वकालं  
तदपि तव गुणानामीश पारं न याति ॥ ३२॥  
  
  
O, great master! Even, if one were to assume that the blue mountain , the  
ocean, the heavenly tree and the earth are the ink,the ink-pot, the pen and  
the paper respectively and the goddess of learning (Saraswati) herself is  
the writer,she will not be able to reach the frontiers of your  
greatness,however long she were to write!                         (32)  
  
असुर-सुर-मुनीन्द्रैरर्चितस्येन्दु-मौलेः  
ग्रथित-गुणमहिम्नो निर्गुणस्येश्वरस्य ।  
सकल-गण-वरिष्ठः पुष्पदन्ताभिधानः  
रुचिरमलघुवृत्तैः स्तोत्रमेतच्चकार ॥ ३३॥  
  
  
The best one among all groups(Gandharva?), PuShpadanta by name, composed  
this charming hymn in none too short metres, in praise of the great lord  
who wears the moon in his head(Shiva), who is worshipped and glorified  by  
all demons, gods and sages and who is beyond all attributes and forms . (33)  
  
अहरहरनवद्यं धूर्जटेः स्तोत्रमेतत्  
पठति परमभक्त्या शुद्ध-चित्तः पुमान् यः ।  
स भवति शिवलोके रुद्रतुल्यस्तथाऽत्र  
प्रचुरतर-धनायुः पुत्रवान् कीर्तिमांश्च ॥ ३४॥  
  
  
Whoever reads this faultless hymn of Shiva daily, with pure mind and great  
devotion, ultimately reaches Shiva's domain and becomes equal to him; in  
this world, he is endowed with children, great wealth,  
long life and fame .                              (34)  
  
महेशान्नापरो देवो महिम्नो नापरा स्तुतिः ।  
अघोरान्नापरो मन्त्रो नास्ति तत्त्वं गुरोः परम् ॥ ३५॥  
  
  
There is no God higher than Mahesha; there is no hymn better than this one.  
There is no `mantra' greater than `OM' and there is no truth or principle  
beyond one's teacher/spiritual guide .                              (35)  
  
दीक्षा दानं तपस्तीर्थं ज्ञानं यागादिकाः क्रियाः ।  
महिम्नस्तव पाठस्य कलां नार्हन्ति षोडशीम् ॥ ३६॥  
  
  
Initiation(into spiritual development), charity, penance,  
pilgrimage,spiritual knowledge and religious acts like sacrifices are not  
capable of yielding even one-sixteenth of the return that will result from  
the reading of this hymn .                              (36)  
  
कुसुमदशन-नामा सर्व-गन्धर्व-राजः  
शशिधरवर-मौलेर्देवदेवस्य दासः ।  
स खलु निज-महिम्नो भ्रष्ट एवास्य रोषात्  
स्तवनमिदमकार्षीद् दिव्य-दिव्यं महिम्नः ॥ ३७॥  
  
  
Kusumadanta(equivalent of PuShpadanta) was the king of all Gandharvas and  
he was a devotee of the Lord of lords, Shiva, who wears the baby moon (with  
a few digits only) in his head . He fell from his glorious position due to  
Shiva's wrath at his misconduct . It was then that the Gandharva composed  
this hymn which is the most divine .                              (37)  
  
सुरगुरुमभिपूज्य स्वर्ग-मोक्षैक-हेतुं  
पठति यदि मनुष्यः प्राञ्जलिर्नान्य-चेताः ।  
व्रजति शिव-समीपं किन्नरैः स्तूयमानः  
स्तवनमिदममोघं पुष्पदन्तप्रणीतम् ॥ ३८॥  
  
  
If an aspirant for heaven and liberation, worships Shiva,the teacher of  
gods, at first and then reads this unfailing hymn, composed by  
PuShpadanta, with folded hands and single-mindedness, he attains Shiva's  
abode, being praised by `kinnaras'(a group of semi-gods known for their  
singing talent).                              (38)  
  
आसमाप्तमिदं स्तोत्रं पुण्यं गन्धर्व-भाषितम् ।  
अनौपम्यं मनोहारि सर्वमीश्वरवर्णनम् ॥ ३९॥  
  
  
Here ends this meritorious,charming and incomparable hymn, uttered by the  
Gandharva, all in description of the great master .                              (39)  
  
इत्येषा वाङ्मयी पूजा श्रीमच्छङ्कर-पादयोः ।  
अर्पिता तेन देवेशः प्रीयतां मे सदाशिवः ॥ ४०॥  
  
  
Thus, this worship in the form of words, is dedicated at the feet of Shri  
Shankara; may the ever-auspicious lord of the gods be  
pleased with this . (40)  
  
तव तत्त्वं न जानामि कीदृशोऽसि महेश्वर ।  
यादृशोऽसि महादेव तादृशाय नमो नमः ॥ ४१॥  
  
  
I do not know the truth of your nature and how you are . O, great God! My  
Salutations are to that nature of yours of which you really are . (41)  
  
एककालं द्विकालं वा त्रिकालं यः पठेन्नरः ।  
सर्वपाप-विनिर्मुक्तः शिव लोके महीयते ॥ ४२॥  
  
  
Whoever reads this once, twice or thrice (in a day) revels in the domain of  
Shiva, bereft of all sins .                              (42)  
  
श्री पुष्पदन्त-मुख-पङ्कज-निर्गतेन  
स्तोत्रेण किल्बिष-हरेण हर-प्रियेण ।  
कण्ठस्थितेन पठितेन समाहितेन  
सुप्रीणितो भवति भूतपतिर्महेशः ॥ ४३॥  
  
  
This hymn which is dear to Shiva, has emerged out of the lotus-like mouth  
of PuShpadanta and is capable of removing all sins . May the lord of all  
beings become greatly pleased with anyone who has learnt this by heart  
and/or reads or recalls this with single-mindedness!            (43)  
  
॥ इति श्री पुष्पदन्त विरचितं शिवमहिम्नः  
         स्तोत्रं समाप्तम् ॥
