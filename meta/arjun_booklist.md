The _Purāṇa_s occupy a high rank amongst India’s literary contribution to the world. In addition to being written lore of the highest magnitude, the _Purāṇa_s have also remained in the oral tradition, percolating to the grassroots. They eminently represent the very nature of _Sanātana-dharma_ and can easily qualify as ‘the encyclopaedia of the commoners.’ While the _Veda_s express the aspirations, inspirations, amazement, and philosophy of the ancient _ṛṣi_s, the _Purāṇa_s make the _Veda_s accessible to the masses in an engaging manner.[\[1\]](#_ftn1) Kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana, the _ṛṣi_ who reorganised the _Veda_s into four and thus gained the epithet ‘Veda-vyāsa’ is said to have authored all the _Purāṇa_s for the welfare of the world.[\[2\]](#_ftn2) The etymology of the word ‘_purāṇa_’ reveals a lot about its content – पुरापि नवं इति पुराणम् – _although ancient, it is eternally new and always relevant_. The stories, ideas, and philosophy contained in the _Purāṇa_s are ancient, but their value is timeless, and hence, relevant to all times. The _Purāṇa_s can be compared to the river Gaṅgā. The divine river has been flowing in the heartland of India for millions of years; yet, at every moment and at every point in its flow, the water is fresh – the waters of Gaṅgā are important and relevant to us, at all times. Though ancient, the Gaṅgā is perennial, eternal, enriching and life-sustaining. Such is the nature of the _Purāṇa_s.

In most Indian languages today, the word _purāṇa_ has almost become synonymous with ‘story.’ The stories from the _purāṇa_s first capture the heart of the audience – both young and old; **through the heart, they enter the head**. Stories first entertain and then educate the reader with universal human values. Winning the heart and the head through the same set of words and sentences is perhaps unique to Indian literature. _Purāṇic_ stories are suggestive in nature. The values of _adhibhūta_ (the material), _adhidaiva_ (the emotional), and _adhyātma_ (the spiritual) are embedded in them, the _adhyātmic_ values being the most important. It is also important to note that whenever there is a divergence of view between the _Purāṇa_s, they will need to be resolved from a _vedāntic_ perspective, rooted in the _brahmaika-tattva_.

While a sizeable part of the _Purāṇa_s contain stories, it should not detract us from the vast scope of the _Purāṇic_ literature. Segments in the _Purāṇa_s speak about geography, administration, architecture, aesthetics, metallurgy, gemmology, medicine, festivals, rituals, law, relationships, and much more. Some _Purāṇa_s also contain aspects of history, which are often peppered with imaginative embellishments. They contain details about _tīrtha-kṣetra_s, _sthala-māhātmyā_s, _vrata_s, and _utsava_. They have the dimensions of both _śāstra_ and _kāvya_. Thus, the _Purāṇa_s are, in the true sense, an encyclopaedia of all sacred and secular aspects of _Sanātana-dharma_. Texts like the _Purāṇa_s are not found elsewhere in the world. Neither the ancient nor the modern civilizations of the world have been able to come up with anything that is close to the _Purāṇa_s in their content, both in quality and quantity.

Tradition lists eighteen _mahāpurāṇa_s, eighteen _upapurāṇa_s, and many _upopapurāṇa_s – most of these are attributed to _Bhagavān_ Veda-vyāsa. These texts are of varying magnitude and importance. They are largely united in spirit but differ in their outer form. It is believed that they find their seed in the _Purāṇa-saṃhitā_ which was put together by Vyāsa’s father Parāśara. Though the historical origin of these texts is shrouded in mystery, the growth of the _Purāṇic_ literature can be compared to that of a banyan tree – though it is a conglomeration of numerous trees, they are all organically united and are manifestations of the main tree; in this case, Vyāsa forms the trunk of the primary tree and represents the philosophical spirit of the _Purāṇa_s.

The next sections provide reference material which could be of use for an ardent student of the Indian culture. The list provided is not an exhaustive bibliography of the _Purāṇic_ literature.

#### **For the General Public**

#### **_Beginners_**

- The _Bhārata-bhāratī_ series published by _Rashtrotthana Sahitya_ contains individual volumes on various _Purāṇic_ characters. They are true to the original and are available in simple English and Kannada
- The _Amar Chitra Katha_ comics published under the editorship of Anant Pai are close to the original texts. They come along with engaging illustrations and a brief summary of the particular story. These are available in English and many Indian languages
- The old editions of _Chandamama_ published in various Indian languages published many stories from the _Purāṇa_s. They maybe accessed by beginners as well

#### **_Intermediate_**

- _Shiva Rama Krishna_ (English) by Shatavadhani Dr. R Ganesh (Translated into English by Hari Ravikumar) serves as a very good model in understanding the deities, their stories and iconography. The author derives material from the _Purāṇa_s as well as the works of masters in Sanskrit and Kannada. This can serve as a guide to understand any _Purāṇa_ and must be read by the young and the old alike. (Published by the Prekshaa Prakashana, also available as a series of articles [https://www.prekshaa.in/series-list/Shiva-Rama-Krishna](https://www.prekshaa.in/series-list/Shiva-Rama-Krishna))
- _Vacana Bhāgavata_ (Kannada) by Ta Su Shamaraya is a beautifully condensed edition of the _Bhāgavata-purāṇa_. (Published by Ramakrishna Ashrama Mysore)
- Kannada lectures of _Shatavadhani_ Dr. R Ganesh on the eighteen _mahā-purāṇa_s and several _upa-purāṇa_s capture the stories, symbology and philosophy in an extremely engaging manner. Recordings are available at the Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs, Bangalore. The lectures provide a holistic approach in understanding the _Purāṇa_s in from the _Sanātanic_ perspective.
- _Itihāsa-purāṇa_ (Kannada) by Prof. KS Kannan (Published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan) provides a good introduction to the _Purāṇa_s.
- _Myths_[**\[3\]**](#_ftn3)_and Legends of the Hindus and Buddhists_ by Sister Nivedita and Ananda Coomaraswamy (Published by the Advaita Ashrama)
- Essays of D.V. Gundappa on the _Rāmāyaṇa_ and _Mahābhārata_ and the introduction to the _Vacana Bhārata_ by A R Krishnasastri can also help readers understand the manner in which _Purāṇa_s need to be interpreted. The reader will also need to be acquainted with basic concepts connected with Indian culture – the works of GC Pande and Swami Harshananda (especially the work _A Concise Encyclopaedia of Hinduism_, published by the Ramakrishna Math) can help in this regard.

After having been acquainted with characters, stories and concepts and having understood the approach to understand them, the student may start going through the complete translations of the _Purāṇa_s. Among these, the _Viṣṇu-purāṇa_ would be a good starting point.

#### **English Translations _(in the order of preference)_**

- Bibek Debroy’s translations of the _Purāṇa_s (and also the _Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata_ and _Harivaṃśa_) are lucid, close to the original and reliable. _Brahma-purāṇa, Bhāgavata-purāṇa_ and _Mārkaṇḍeya-purāṇa_ are available currently and are published by Penguin Classics. His prose retellings of the _Purāṇa_s published by B. R. Publishing Corporation are worth reading as well.
- Manmatha Nath Dutt’s translations of various _Purāṇa_s are largely reliable, especially if the reader has some knowledge of the Sanskrit language.
- Motilal Banarsidass Publishers have made available verse by verse English translations of most of the major _Purāṇa_s. The translations have been made by a board of scholars. Though largely reliable, the essence of quite a number of Sanskrit terms is lost in translation.

#### **Kannada Translations _(in the order of preference)_**

- _Mahāmahopādhyāya_ Vid. N Ranganatha Sharma’s translations of the _Viṣṇu-purāṇa_ (complete) and _Bhāgavata-purāṇa_ (_skandha_s 10, 11, 12) are lucid, intimate and highly reliable. His introductory forewords to the works are also insightful. The volumes come with the original text in Kannada letters along with verse-by-verse translation.

#### **Encyclopaedia and Indices**

- _Purāṇic Encyclopaedia_ compiled by Vettam Mani is an excellent volume. Important characters, deities, places and concepts are arranged in an alphabetical order and concepts connected with them are compiled from all the major _purāṇa_s as well as the Vedas, _Rāmāyaṇa_ and _Mahābhārata_. This can work as a single source for any reference connected with _purāṇa_s. (Motilal Banarsidass Publishers)
