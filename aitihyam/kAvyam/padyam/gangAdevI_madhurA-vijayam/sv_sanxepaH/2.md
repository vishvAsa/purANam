In time the King sired upon the Queen  
the seed which would perpetuate the dynasty –  
just as the creator sires upon primaeval matter  
the energy which brings into being the three worlds.

<details><summary>Shankar & Venetia</summary>

Slender,  
no more oppressed by ornaments,  
her round face reed-pale,  
the Queen resembled a river run to a trickle in Śarad,  
no longer blanketed in day-blossoming lotus blooms,  
harbouring the orbed moon  
as night draws near.

The pregnant queen’s cravings   
ever veered towards the heroic,   
suggesting that the royal heir she would soon bear  
would author deeds assayed by no other.

So spent was her strength  
she couldn’t even reach  
the foot of the ornamental hill  
where fawns scampered,  
yet in her thirst for a kill  
she dreamed of climbing the mighty Malaya mountain  
to hunt maddened lions.

‘The earth for a chariot;  
Brahmā himself the charioteer.  
The king of snakes serving as bowstring,  
and Mount Meru his bow.  
And, so they say,  
no less than Śauri[^1] as his shaft.  
To fight whom?  
A mere triad of cities!’  
Thus did she scorn Śiva,  
conqueror of the three cities.[^2]

[^2]: Śiva had all this and more when he went to fight the *asuras’* Tripura.

A fresh line of fine hair flashed below her navel –  
glistening like a streak of ichor from  
the mighty elephant of her waxing fortune –  
as though it were a cobra  
come to guard the luminous treasure  
buried deep within her womb.[^3]

[^3]: Snakes are often thought of as guardians of treasure.

Then on the happy day –  
declared by astrologers near and far  
to be blessed with an auspicious star –  
the earthly lord’s lady  
bore a son who would lead a mighty army;  
just as Pārvatī,  
consort to the moon-crested Śiva,  
bore Kumāra, leader of heaven’s army.

At that moment,  
the faces of the directions grew clear  
as if washed clean by the gleaming child’s glory,  
white as the flood of the milky sea spilling its shores.

Realising that sacrificial oblations

the fire danced a jig of joy,  
weaving his mass of flames into worshipful arcs –

Upon the Emperor’s orders,

Then the King,

Longing to look upon his new-born son,   
he came to his queens’ quarters

He beheld his son  
rocking in the lap of the Queen,  
her thin frame grown frail,

As the child formed fists again and again

it seemed he was practising

As the King drank in his son with his eyes,  
the happiness within him swelled to bursting

so that he prickled with goosebumps.
