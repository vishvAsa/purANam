At that point the sun,  
as if filled with terror  
at the crime he had committed  
in trying to make lotuses as radiant  
as the lotus-faces of the King’s wives,  
scurried to a cave  
buried deep in the setting mountain.

Sucked clean of energy by lotuses,  
swiftly sank the sun into the western sea,  
chariot reverberating as he raced downwards,  
seemingly to replenish his heat from the fire in the deep.[^1]

The full cheeks of Varuṇa’s wives,  
reddened by the rays of the setting sun,  
took on the rosy flush of wine  
though they had not  
touched a drop.[^2]

[^2]: Varuṇa, lord of the sea, presides over the western direction.[^4]: Floral patterns were drawn upon women’s faces for decoration.[^6]: It is at night that the moon rises, causing the sea to swell.[^8]: Lotuses bloom only in the presence of their lord, the sun.

The scorching torment the sun suffered  
in parting from his first lover, the East,  
vanished in the arms of the next, the West.  
Who can fathom the hearts of those red-hot with passion?

The sun’s reflection,

looked like a ruby staircase  
readied for him to descend from the heavens.

Whistling all the while,

as each petal-door was pulled to.
