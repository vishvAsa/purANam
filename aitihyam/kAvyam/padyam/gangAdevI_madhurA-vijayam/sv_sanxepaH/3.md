In due course,  
once he had undergone  
the *caula* ceremony  
as he ought,  
His Majesty Kampa fast mastered all major disciplines –  
schooled by a *guru*,  
though he had no need for schooling.

Youth suddenly succeeded childhood.  
And his youth was  
the lake where Kāma, as elephant, wallows;  
the blossom upon the tree  
that was the nation’s adoration;  
the moonlight cherished by the *cakora*-like eyes  
of heavy-hipped ladies.

Glorying in his beauty,  
he must have trampled  
upon Kāma’s triumphal banner.  
Why else did the perfectly formed lines  
upon his soles so soft  
assume the shape of a fish?[^1]

[^1]: Kāma’s banner is emblazoned with a fish.  
Lines upon the soles of the feet in the form of a fish are 
one of the signs of a *cakravartī*, a supreme emperor.

The slender circumference of his waist –  
setting off his stately physique –  
seemed to be a peace offering  
made by lions,  
kings of the jungle,  
their hearts trembling at the thought of his might.

The Prince had a majestic mane of hair

daubed with the passion he aroused.

At length  
the Sovereign wedded his son,

‘My son,

‘The dissolute are like rutting elephants.  
Both are blind,  
one with a pompous pride,  
the other with streams of rut that form a river.  
Forever in thrall to *rajas*[^2],  
the men are as depraved  
as the mud-splattered beasts are filthy.  
A mind deadened by overindulgence  
frustrates the libertine;  
a taming post the elephant.  
Neither gives ear to their master.
10

[^2]: *Rajas* is physical dirt as well as being the *guṇa* or quality characterised by excessive passion.

At length, after the prayers of the near-drawing evening,

Raring to raze their rivals, he bid them head to bed,  
while he in his sleeping quarters  
relaxed with his wives so dear, full of cheer.
