The blood-stained pearls flooding forth  
as warriors sliced open rutting elephants’ temples  
with sharp swords  
seemed to be a shower of sparks  
as iron struck bone.

A rabble of night-roaming *rākṣasas*,  
inverting elephant trunks to make straws,  
slurped with satisfied burps  
the blood streaming from the beasts’ temples,  
spitting out the pearls.

A jackal came up to the corpse of an elephant,  
but bolted,  
though it was dead and he was ravenous –  
for the birds that had entered it searching for spoils  
were setting it ashudder  
as if with new life.

One man –

showering arrows upon him in seething anger –  
now become immortal,  
showered flowers upon his assassin

The King,  
tearing apart the temples of the mightiest of elephants,  
made hundreds of Tāmraparṇī rivers flow  
all over the battlefield  
as streams of blood gushed forth  
pebbled with pearls.

As his javelin rent each elephant’s temples,  
letting loose a flood of pearls,  
the beasts came to resemble Mount Krauñca  
when Kumāra’s spear pierced it clean through  
setting forth a stream of *haṃsas*.[^1]

[^1]: The god Kumāra blasted a hole through this Himalayan mountain, thus creating a shortcut for *haṃsas* flying to Mount Kailāsa.

With such force did the warrior

eyes bulging out,  
sunk with a plunk into their necks.

At that moment,  
seeing his men running helter-skelter across the battlefield,  
the Yavana king,  
twanging his fearsome bow,  
attacked King Kampa  
as Vṛtra did Indra, king of the gods.

The sound from the Sultan’s bowstring  
as he twanged it forcefully  
seemed to be the sudden trill of anklets  
as his goddess of victory  
after so many years  
started from his side,   
abandoning him.

The Yavana lord’s arrows accosted the King  
like the come-hither glances of Victory herself;  
but those fired by Kampa assailed the Persian  
like the menacing leer of dusky Death.

Arrows that had served as  
snakes to the vital air of the Kerala king,  
wildfires to the flourishing tree

suns destroying the grand dragoons of darkness,   
the Andhras –  
such arrows did the King let loose upon the Sultan.

In a split second

As his rival rained arrows upon him

the King severed with his own arrow  
the Turk’s bow string,  
as though it were the sacred marital chord  
worn by the goddess of his reign.[^2]

Never had the Sultan's head sunk to sycophancy.
