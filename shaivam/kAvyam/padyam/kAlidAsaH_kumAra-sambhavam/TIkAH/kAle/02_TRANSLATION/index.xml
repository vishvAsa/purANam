      <description>&lt;p&gt;(1.) There is, in the northern quarter, the deity-sould lord of mountains (lit. immovable ones), by name Himalaya (the mansion of snow), who stands like the measuring rod of the earth, spanuing (the distance between; lit. having eutered) the Eastern and the Western occeans.&#xA;(2.) Whom, all the mountains, having fixed upon as the calf, while mount Meru, clever in milking, stood as the milker, milked from the earth (in the shape of a cow ), as directed by Prithu, brilliant jewels and great medicinal herbs. Snow could not be a destroyer of beauty in the case of him who is the source of countless jewels; for one blemish is lost in a host of virtues, like the spot on the moon in her rays.&#xA;་&#xA;(4.) Who bears on his peaks, a richness of metals, appearing like an untimely twilight, which, with its colours reflected into the pieces of clouds, leads to the amorous decking of the Apsarases (heavenly nymphs).&#xA;(5.) To whose sunny peaks the Siddhas repair (for comfort) when troubled by showers, after having enjoyed the shadow fallen on the peaks below the clouds floating round the mountain&amp;rsquo;s zone.&#xA;(6.) Where the Kirâtas (mountaineers) track the spoor of the lions that have killed elephants by the pearls dropping from the cavities of their claws, though they do not see their foot-marks, the blood stains being washed away by the streamlets of melted snow.&#xA;(7.) Where the barks of the birch trees, having characters written on them with mineral fluld, and so resembling the red spots on (the bodies of full grown) elephants, become useful to the Vidyadhara damsels for amatory correspondence.&#xA;(8.) Who, as if wishes to play an accompaniment to (swell the music of) the Kinnaras, singing in a high pitch, by filling the holes of the bamboos with the wind breathed from the mouths of the caves.&#xA;*&#xA;(*)&#xA;Where the odour, born of the milky juice flowing from the cedar (Sarala) trees, rubbed against by elephants to ease the itching sensation of their temples, makes the peaks fragrant.&#xA;(10.) Where the (phosphorescent) herbs with their lustre shed into the interior of the caves, serve, at night, as lights requiring no feeding of oil, at the time of the amorous sports of the forest dwellers accompanied by fair females.&#xA;(11.)&#xA;Where the As&amp;rsquo;vamukhi women do not leave off their lazy gait, bowed down as they are by (the weight of) the hips and full breasts difficult to bear, on the path on which the snow has formed into blocks, and which therefore bites the sides of the toes and the heels.&#xA;(12.) Who protects from the sun (the maker of light) in his caves darkness, hiding there for shelter, being as it were afraid of light (like the night-bird); indeed, with the exalted, a feeling of kinship (that he is their own) extends to the lowliest suppliant seeking their protection as to the&#xA;(most) excellent.&#xA;(13.) Where the yaks prove his title, the &amp;ldquo;Lord of the mountains,&amp;rdquo; to be significant by (waving over him) the chauries (in the shape of their tails) as white as the rays of the moon, and having their beauty extended all round by the movements of the tails.&#xA;(14.) Where the clouds, with their forms accidentally hanging over the entrances to the caverns serving as houses, become the screens for the women of the Kinnaras, shy at their garments being snatched away.&#xA;(15.) From which the wind, which bears along with it the spray of the current of the Ganges and which ever and anon shakes the Devadârus (gods, trees) is enjoyed by the hunters who have done stalking the deer, agitating as it does the peacock&amp;rsquo;s feathers (attached by them to their waists).&#xA;(16.) Whose lotuses, growing in the lakes on the highest summits and left after being collected by the hands of the seven sages, the sun, moving on a lower level, blossoms by rays shooting upwards.&#xA;(17.) On observing him as the source of sacrificial requisites, and his strength as capable of holding up the earth,&#xA;(3)&#xA;the Lord of creation himself conferred on him the sovereignty of the mountains with a share in the sacrificial offerings attached to it.&#xA;(18.) To maintain the continuity of his line, he, a kinsman of Meru, knowing rectitude, married, according to (proper) rites, Mená, the mind-born daughter of the Pitrs, equal to himself and respected of the sages.&#xA;(19.) In course of time, as they began to enjoy connubial life worthy of their respective) charms, the consort of the Mountain-lord, possessed of charming youth, conceived a&#xA;child.&#xA;(20.)&#xA;She gave birth to Maináka, who wedded a Nága damsel, who contracted friendship with the ocean (to hide himself in) and who never experienced the pain of the wounds made by the thunderbolt even when the foe of Vitra, the cleaver of pinions, was enraged.&#xA;Then the chaste Satf, the daughter of Daksha and the former wife of Bhava (S′iva ), who, driven by the insult offered by her father (to her lord) had abandoned her body by (means of) yoga, resorted to the Mountain&amp;rsquo;s consort for rebirth.&#xA;(22.) That blessed one (Uma) was begotten on her (Menâ), who was always self-restrained (or, devoted to the performance of holy rites), by the Mountain-lord, as prosperity is produced by the quality of energy from policy not failing in its operation on account of its being well directed.&#xA;(23.) Her birthday conduced to the happiness of embodied beings, both movable and immovable; a day when the quarters brightened, when the wind blew but without dust, and wherein there was a shower of flowers following close upon the music of conches.&#xA;(24.) The mother (lit. the progenitor) shone very brightly by her daughter, having a halo of refulgent lustre ; as shines the land adjoining the Turquoise hills by the rays of gems shooting up at (responsive to ) the roar of the new clouds.&#xA;(25.) As days rolled by, she, who had got her birth, growing, developed extraordinary graces as does the newly risen crescent of the moon waxing day by day other digits hidden in her lustre.&#xA;(4)&#xA;(26.) Her, the darling of her relatives, they called by the patronymic name of Párvatf; the maiden of a pleasing face came to be called Umà (only) afterwards, when forbidden by her mother to do penance with the words &amp;ldquo;U ma&amp;rsquo; (0, do not ).”&#xA;(27.) The eyes of the Mountain-lord, though having a son, were never satiated with resting on this his child; the row of bees, indeed, is more fondly attached to the mango tree (blossoms), though the vernal season blooms with countless flowers.&#xA;(28.) By her he received (additional) sanctity and was also glorified, even as the lamp is by its exceedingly brilliant flame or the heavenly path by the Ganges (lit. the river of three courses) or the wise by refined speech.&#xA;(29.) In childhood surrounded by her companions, she, entering, as it were, into the spirit of sport often played with balls and dolls (made of cloth &amp;amp;c.) and with altars built on the sands of the Ganges.&#xA;(30.) To her, whose impressions (of the previous life) were pernianent, the lores, acquired in the past life, came at the time of instructing her, as do the flocks of swans to the Ganges, in autumn, or their own lustre to the medical herbs at night.&#xA;(31.)&#xA;Now she reached an age, beyond childhood, which is in itself an embellishment, not artificial, to the slim body, a cause of exhilaration not known as wine, a missile of Káma (but) other than the flowery one.&#xA;(32.) Her body, charming in its perfect symmetry, was unfolded ( developed) by fresh youth like a painting gradually growing under the brush (of a painter), or like a lotus blooming under the ( influence of the) rays of the sun.&#xA;(33.) Her feet, while treading, gave to the earth the ever-sbifting beauty of land-lotuses in the shape of the radiance of her raised great toe and nails emitting, as it were, red colour.&#xA;(34.) She, with a body stooping (on account of the weight of her breasts), was instructed, as it were, in the matter of her gait, wherein the tread appeared graceful through playful gestures, by the royal swans, themselves desirous of receiving instruction in return as they wanted to learn the music of her anklets.&#xA;(5)&#xA;(35.) The Creator, after he had fashioned her beautiful thighs, not very long, rounded and symmetrical, had to make an effort, as it were, for the production of excellent beauty when forming her other limbs.&#xA;(36.) The trunks of lordly elephants through toughness of skin and the plantain-stalks through their extreme coldness were unfit as standards of comparison for her thighs, though having a plump, rounded shape.&#xA;(37.) The beauty of the resting place of the zone of her, who was faultless, could, indeed, be inferred from this that it was placed, in after times (i. e. after her austerities were over), by Girisha, (S&amp;rsquo;iva) on his lap, which it was not possible even to be coveted by another female.&#xA;(38.) The delicate line of down which entered her deep navel after passing the knot of her garment (at the waist), appeared like the shooting ray of the central gem of her zone which was other than white (a sapphire).&#xA;(39.) She, with a slender waist resembling the middle of an altar, had three charming folds of skin (on her waist) as if they were a flight of stairs raised there by blooming youth for the God of love to ascend.&#xA;(40.) Of her, the lily-eyed one, the two breasts, yellowish white, having black nipples and pressing against each other, were so rounded that as much space as could be occupied even by a lotus fibre was impossible to be found between them.&#xA;3་,!&#xA;(41.) I fancy her arms were more delicate than even the S&amp;rsquo;irfsha flower, since they were thrown as chains round the neck of Hara by the fish-bannered God, although vanquished.&#xA;(42.) In the case of her neck gracefully elevated over her breasts and her encircling pearl-necklace, the condition of being the adorned and the adorner was indifferently exchangeable owing to each bringing beauty to the other.&#xA;(43.) The unsteady Goddess of beauty, could not enjoy (possess) the charms of the lotus when with the moon, and of the lunar graces when with the lotus ; but when she betook herself to the face of Umá, she enjoyed the pleasure (coming from the charms) peculiar to both.&#xA;(6)&#xA;(44.) If a white flower were laid upon a young tender leaf or a pearl were to rest on the richest (lit. spotless) coral, then only could either vie with the sweet smile that played about (lit. whose lustre was shed over) her rosy lip.&#xA;(45.) While she, who had a musical sound, spoke in a voice that distilled nectar as it were, even the koil (lit. bred by others), was to the ears of the listeners full of jarring notes, like a harp, out of tune, when played upon.&#xA;(46.) The timid ( unsteady) glances which were not dissimilar to the blue lotus (tremulous) in a strong wind, did the female fawns borrow from her, or she with elongated eyes from them ?&#xA;(47.) On seeing the beauty, charming in its sportiveness, of her long arching brows, pencilled as it were with black paint, ihe bodiless God gave up all pride in the beauty of his (curved) bow.&#xA;(48.) If there can be a sense of shame in the minds of the lower animals, then the female Chamaras will, undoubtedly, grow cold in their fondness for their hair on seeing the magnificent tresses of the daughter of the Mountain-lord.&#xA;(49.) In short she was created by the Creator of the universe with great effort, as if with a desire to see all beauty combined in one form, by gathering together all the standards of comparison and placing them, each in its place.&#xA;(50.) Once, it is said, Nàrada, who roams at will, on seeing that girl near her father, declared that she would be Hara&amp;rsquo;s one bride who would share half of his body through love.&#xA;(51.) For this reason her father remained (indifferent), setting aside all thought of another bridegroom for her, although she had reached the age of adolescence: (for) an oblation, sanctified by mantras, lustrous objects other than fire do not deserve.&#xA;(52.)&#xA;The Mountain could not offer his child to the God of gods unsolicited: a wise man resorts to neutrality even in the matter of his desired object through fear of his request being refused.&#xA;(53.) When that lady, of pearly teeth, abandoned her body through resentment against Daksha in her former birth,&#xA;(7)&#xA;just from that time the Lord of beings (S&amp;rsquo;iva), giving up all attachment (to worldly pleasures) lived without a wife.&#xA;(54.) He, with a skin for his garment, and with his mind controlled, dwelt, for the purpose of practising austerities, on some peak of the Snow-mansion, where the sacred fir trees were laved by the current of the Ganges, which was odoriferous with the fragrance of musk, and where there was the music of heavenly minstrels (Kinnaras).&#xA;(55.) And his attendant troops, with the flowers of the Nameru trees for their ear-ornaments, clad in the barks of the birch trees soft to touch and annointed with mineral (red arsenic) dyes, sat on the rocks coated with fragrant resin.&#xA;(56.) His bull (having a prominent hump) uttering a pleasing bellow of pride, digging with his hoofs the rocks of collected snow, and looked at with great difficulty by the terrified gayals, bellowed aloud there, intolerant of the roar of the lions.&#xA;(57.) He, of eight forms, himself the giver of the fruit of penance, having set up a fire there, kindled with sacrificial wood and another manifestation of himself, practised austerities with some unknown object.&#xA;(58.) The mountain-lord having worshipped him of inestimable worth and adored by the gods ( lit, the denizens of heaven), with the customary offerings, directed his daughter of restrained soul, together with her (two) female friends, to wait upon (or propitiate) him.&#xA;(59.) S&amp;rsquo;iva (lit. the Mountain-dweller) allowed her to serve him according to her desire although an obstruction to contemplation; for they alone are steady whose minds are not affected in the presence of the cause of perturbation.&#xA;(60.) Culling flowers for offerings, assiduous in cleaning the altar and bringing water for the performance of holy rites and the Kus&amp;rsquo;a grass-thus did she, having lovely tresses, attend upon S&amp;rsquo;iva every day, her fatigue being allayed by the rays of the lunar digit on his head.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(1.) At that time the denizens of heaven, harassed by Taraka, went to the abode of the self-existent God, Bramhá, having placed Indra (the speedy-vanquisher) at their head.&#xA;(2.) Brahmà revealed himself to them, the lustre of whose faces had faded away, as does the sun (the possessor of bright rays) to the lakes with sleeping (closed) lotuses in the morning.&#xA;(3.) Then, having bowed to him, who has a face on every side, who is the creator of all, and who is the lord of speech, they propitiated him with appropriate (lit. full of sense) speeches.&#xA;(4.) Salutation to thee of three forms, the one soul before the creation of the world, who afterwards dividedst thyself into the three Gunas (Satva, Rajas and Tamas ) and manifestedst a variety (of forms).&#xA;(5.) O uuborn one, the universe, composed of things that move and that do not move, has sprung from the ever prolific seed which was cast by thee in the waters; hence art thou glorified as its source.&#xA;(6.) Manifesting thy might by the three forms (lit. three states characterised by the three qualities), thou alone hast come to be the cause of the creation, the protection and the retraction ( of the universe).&#xA;(7.) Male and female are the separate manifestations of thy own self, (thus) split up through the desire of creating; and these are declared as the parents of the creation that sprang into existence.&#xA;(8.) The waking and slumbering of thee, who hast separated thy day and night by the measure of thy own time, are (represent the period of) the creation and destruction of all things.&#xA;(9.) Thyself without a source, thou art the source of the universe; thyself endless, thou art the end of the universe; without beginning, thou art the beginning of the universe; and thyself lordless, thou art the lord of the universe!!&#xA;(10.) Thou knowest thyself in thyself, thou createst thyself by thyself and thou art absorbed in thyself by thy own mighty self.11.&#xA;(9)&#xA;Thou art fluid and hard on account of the close contact of the particles (adhesion); gross and subtile; light and yet heavy; perceptible and yet the opposite of that; thy will is absolute in the (manifestation of the) energies (or miraculous powers).&#xA;(12.) Thou art the source of those speeches (Vedas), the introduction of which is by (the syllable) Om, the utterance of which is in threefold intonation, the rite to be performed by which is sacrifice, and the fruit of which is heaven.&#xA;(13.) They declare thee as the Prakriti operating for the benefit of the soul (Purusha); and they know thee alone to be the Purusha, the indifferent (passive) witness of (the operations of) the Prakriti.&#xA;(14.) Thou art the father of the manes, god of the gods, higher than the high and the progenitor of the progenitors of mankind.&#xA;(15.) Thou, the eternal one, art the sacrificial offering and again its offerer (the sacrificer), the enjoyed and the enjoyer, the knowable and also the knower, the meditator and again the supreme object of meditation.&#xA;(16.) Having heard from them these praises, thus uttered, truthful and going (pleasing) to the heart, the Creator, inclined to show favour, answered the gods thus :&#xA;(17.) Of that primeval bard, the fourfold (2.e. having a fourfold excellence) flow of words (speech) being uttered from the four mouths, was successful (or had its object gained).&#xA;(18.) Welcome to you, O gods of mighty valour, who, having held your (respective) high posts by your might, have come here in a body and who have pole-like (long) arms (i. e. reaching upto the knee).&#xA;(19.) Why is it that your faces do not show their wonted glow like stars with their gleam dimmed by a mist?&#xA;(20.) This thunderbolt of the destroyer of Vritra, not displaying its variegated splendour (rain-bow) on account of the loss of its radiance, appears to have its edges blunted. 21. The noose in the hand of Varuna, Irresistible to the enemy, is reduced to the helplessness of a serpent, whose prowess is repressed by a spell.&#xA;(10)&#xA;(22.) The arm of Kubera, from which the mace is cast off, and which, therefore, appearing like a tree with its branches broken, hints, as it were, at a defeat, that has been like a dart in the heart (rankling in his mind).&#xA;(23.) Even Yama, scratching the ground with his rod having its lustre entirely gone, brings to it, invincible once, the insignificance of a quenched firebrand (for marking the earth).&#xA;(24.) How have these A&amp;rsquo;dityas, cool on account of the loss of their burning lustre, come to the condition of being gazed on at will, as if painted in pictures?&#xA;(25.) The halting of the speed of the Maruts (wind-gods) can be guessed from their faltering motion, as is the stoppage of their current from the refluence of waters.&#xA;(26.) The heads of the Rudras, with their crescents hanging from the knots of matted hair, bent low (through shame of defeat) tell of the quelling of their deep gutteral sounds (their weapons).&#xA;(27.) Have you, who had already gained position (established your pre-eminence), been thrown down from it by &amp;lsquo;your more powerful enemies, as general rules are overthrown (set aside) by special ones (exceptions)?&#xA;(28.) Say then, my children, what crave you, coming here together? With me rests the creation of the world, with you its protection.&#xA;(29.) Then Vàsava urged the preceptor (of the gods) with (a motion of) his thousand eyes, that appeared beautiful like a bed of lotuses shaken by a gentle wind.&#xA;(30.) He, the twofold eye of Hari, greater (more serviceable to him) than his one thousand eyes-he, Vâchaspati (the lord of speech) spoke to him, the lotus-throned one (Brahmá), with hands folded (in supplication).&#xA;(31.) O Lord, what you said is so: our high position is snatched away from us by our foes. O mighty One, how should you not know it when your soul pervades each and every creature!&#xA;(32.) A mighty demon uamed Ta&amp;rsquo;raka, grown insolent by a boon obtained from you, has risen to torment the world, like a comet.&#xA;( 11 )&#xA;(33.) To his town the Sun sends his rays in such numbers only as will suffice to awaken (cause to bloom) the lotuses in his pleasure-lakes. (He is afraid of shining in all his glory.)&#xA;(34.) On him the Moon waits with all his digits at all times (in both the halfs); only he keeps back the digit that forms the crest-gem of S&amp;rsquo;iva.&#xA;(35.) The Wind, with his motion in his garden stopped through fear of (punishment for) stealing (bearing) away flowers, does not blow near him with greater force than is produced by a fan.&#xA;(36.) And the Seasons, ever diligent in providing a stock of flowers, wait upon him, as if they were (nothing more than) his gardeners, giving up for the time a succession of service.&#xA;(37.) The Lord of rivers (the sea) anxiously awaits the developing of precious stones, fit to be offered as presents to him, in the bosom of water.&#xA;(38.) The serpents, with Vàsuki at their head, with their blazing jewel-lustres, wait upon him at night, serving as fixed lamps.&#xA;(39.) Even Indra, desirous of securing favour done by him, tries again and again to win him over with the precious flowers of the desire-granting trees (Kalpadrumas) sent by massengers.&#xA;(40.) Though served in this way, he harrasses the three worlds. A wicked person can be put down only by a retaliation of injury and not by an act of kindness.&#xA;(41.) By him are the trees of the Nandana grove, the leaves of which were tenderly plucked by the wives of the Immortals, made to experience cuttings and fallings.&#xA;(42.) When asleep, he is fanned by the captive heavenly damsels with chauries. showering the spray of tears, and raising wind light like breathing.&#xA;(43.) He has built pleasure-mountains in his residences having rooted up peaks of Meru, (once) struck by the hoofs of the Sun&amp;rsquo;s coursers.&#xA;(44.) The water of the heavenly Ganges, made oily by the rut of the elephants of the quarters, is alone left now&#xA;( 12 )&#xA;(i. e. without its golden lotuses), while his pleasure-lakes have become the abode of the harvest of golden lotuses.&#xA;(45.)&#xA;The love of seeing different worlds is no more entertained by the gods, as the path of the aerical cars has become desolate through fear of being attacked by him.&#xA;(46.) He, versed in magic arts, snatches away from the mouth of fire, the oblation offered by the sacrificers (in due form) in sacrifices when instituted, while we look on ( helplessly).&#xA;(47.) He has borne away the well-known Uchchais&amp;rsquo;ravas, the jewel of horses, who was, as it were, the long acquired glory of Indra in a bodily form.&#xA;(48.) All our efforts against the wicked wretch are turned to naught, as herbs of powerful healing virtue, against a joint distemper of the three humours malignly disturbed.&#xA;(49.) The discus of Harí, whereon rested our hope of success, offered itself, as it were, like a gold ornament round his deck, with a stream of lustre (only) flashing forth from it as it clashed ( against his bosom ).&#xA;(50.) Now his elephants, who have vanquished Airàvata, are practising butting against the clouds, such as Pushkaràvartaka and others.&#xA;(51.) O Almighty God, we, therefore desire to create a leader to destroy him, as those desirous of salvation wish to raise religious virtue, which cuts off the fetters of Karman.&#xA;(52.) Whom, the defender of the heavenly host, having placed in the foremost place, the Breaker-of-mountains (Indra) will lead back the Glory of victory, like one taken captive.&#xA;(53.) When this address was concluded, the Self-exis tent One uttered a speech, which far surpassed, in sweetness ( its refreshing effect), a shower falling after thunder.&#xA;(54.) This your desire will be gratified; wait some time: but I will not, myself, undertake the work of creation for its fulfilment ( i, e. producing a leader).&#xA;(55.) The demon who acquired his glory from here, ought not to have destruction from here; it is improper to cut down even a poisonous tree when (once) nurtured by oneself.&#xA;( 18 )&#xA;(56.) Formerly this (viz. freedom from death at the hands of the gods) he sought (as a boon) and the same I granted him; and (thus) by a boon made his penance, capable of burning the worlds, nugatory.&#xA;(57.) Who but a portion of the energy of the Blacknecked one (S&amp;rsquo;iva) dropped (on favourable ground) can withstand him who is warlike when ready to attack in a battle?&#xA;(58.) That God (S&amp;rsquo;iva) is the supreme soul (lit. highest lustre) reigning beyond the region of darkness (the quality of Tamas)-he, the extent of&#xA;of whose prowess cannot be accurately gauged either by me or by Vishnu.&#xA;(59.) So you, who are desirous of achieving your object. should try to draw away (tempt) the mind of S&amp;rsquo;iva, steadied by self-restraint (or firmly fixed on contemplation) (towards matrimony) by means of the beauty of Umà, like iron by a magnet.&#xA;(60.) Only these two are capable of bearing the seed of us two when deposited-Umà of S&amp;rsquo;iva and his watery form of me.&#xA;(61.) (Another form of) the self (son) of that S&amp;rsquo;iva, having taken up the leadership of your host, will loosen the braids of the captive heavenly damsels by the glory of his might.&#xA;(62.) Having addressed the gods thus the Creator of the universe vanished (from sight); and the gods, too, went back to the celestial world with what was to be done firmly settled in their minds.&#xA;(63.) Having fixed upon Kandarpa (as the proper agent to be employed) in that business, the chastiser of Pâka (Indra) approached him by the mind, the speed of which was doubled by his eagerness for the accomplishment of the object.&#xA;(64.) Then the flower-bowed god, with his bow, the ends of which were as beautiful as the arching brows of graceful women, slung over his neck bearing the marks of the bracelets of Rati, and having his missile, the young sprouts of mango trees, deposited in the hands of his friend Madhu (vernal season), approached the&#xA;approached the Performer-of bundred-sacrifices (Indra) with folded hands.&#xA;K. T. 2&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(1.) The thousand eyes of (Indra) simultaneously alighted on him, leaving the gods; generally the regard of lords for their dependents changes according to the purpose they desire to be accomplished.&#xA;(2.) He was allowed a place near his own throne by Vasava with the words &amp;ldquo;sit here;&amp;rdquo; and he, having acknowledged the courtesy of his master by (a reverential inclination of) his head began to speak to him in private thus-&#xA;(3.) O you who discern the special qualifications of men, command what you desire to be done in the (three) worlds, I should like this your favour shown by your remembrance (of me) to be enhanced by (the execution of) a command.&#xA;(4.) By whom, desirous of getting your post, has your vengeance been roused by mighty (lit. exceedingly prolonged) austerities? For in a trice shall he be within the range of this my bow on which an arrow has been fixed.&#xA;(5.) Who, undesired by you, is seeking the path of salvation through fear of rebirth? Let him long stand fettered down to wordly existence by the side-long glances, bewitching with the play of the eyebrows, of beautiful women.&#xA;(6.) Say, of what foe of yours shall I, employing as my messenger sensuality, obstruct the temporal and spiritual advancement, although he be instructed in morality by Ushanas himself, as the flooded current of a river obstructs its two banks?&#xA;(7.) What lady (having full buttocks) painfully keeping the vow of chastity, who has made a niche in your unsteady (lustful) mind by her beauty, do you wish to be compelled to twine her arms round your neck, of her own accord, abandoning all (sense of) shame ?&#xA;(8.) O gallant, by what lady naturally passionate, have you been spurned for your infidelity in love although fallen at her feet? Her body shall I subject to strong repentance and make it (helplessly) resort to a couch of tender sprouts.&#xA;( 15 )&#xA;(9.) O mighty one, be pleased; let your bolt rest; what foe of yours should quall, with the might of his arms rendered unavailing even before women, with lips curling through passion?&#xA;(10.) Although flower-armed, taking Madhu (the presiding deity of the vernal season) alone for my associate, shall I break down (through your favour) the self-restraint even of the Trident-holder (S&amp;rsquo;iva). What are other bowmen before me then?&#xA;11, Then Akhandala (Indra) having taken his leg off his thigh and honoured the footstool by placing it upon it, thus spoke to Kàma who had declared his power as equal to the ( achievement of the ) object he had in view-&#xA;(12.)&#xA;Friend, all is possible for you to do; I have but the two weapons, yourself and my bolt; my bolt (however) is powerless against those mighty with the power of austerities, while you go (unchallenged) everywhere and accomplish every thing.&#xA;(13.) I know your strength, and hence employ you in acts of grave import as I would do myself; Krishna has assigned to S&amp;rsquo;esha the duty of bearing his body, on observing his capability to uphold the world.&#xA;(14.) In talking of the power of your arrow to hit the Bull-emblemed God (S&amp;rsquo;iva), you have almost undertaken our work: know that at present this is just the desired object of the gods (lit. those who have an allotted portion in a sacrifice) who have powerful foes.&#xA;(15.) The divine beings desire to have a leader for their host, sprung from the energy of Bhava, that they can conquer their foes. And he, the repository (or source) of the principal and accessary mantras, who has concentrated his mind on Brahma, can be subdued ( managed) by the fall of&#xA;your one arrow.&#xA;(16.) Strive to make him, who is self-restrained, love the devoted daughter of Himàlaya; of all women she alone is the proper ground for the depositing of his seed-so has declared the Self-born ( Brahmá ).&#xA;(17.) And the daughter of the Mountain-lord, at her father&amp;rsquo;s bidding, waits upon the Eternal one (S&amp;rsquo;iva )&#xA;( 10 )&#xA;practising penance ou the high region of Himàlaya-so have I heard from the lips of the heavenly nymphs; (for) they form my band of spies.&#xA;(18.) So then go to accomplish this business; do the work of the gods. This purpose can only be attained by the achievment of another object: it, (therefore ), has need of you as its primary cause as the sprouting up of a seed requires water before it can make its appearance.&#xA;(19.) On him, the means of the attainment of victory by the gods, your missile only, we grant, has power; you are blessed; (the performance of ) a deed, not accomplished by any other person, although unknown to fame, is the glory of men.&#xA;20, These gods are your suppliants; the business (you have to accomplish) is ( for the benefit) of the three worlds; and the deed done by your bow is not very cruel : O wonder! Your prowess is to be envied !!&#xA;(21.) O disturber of the peace of mind, Spring (Madhu) is your helper, though unasked, through your comradeship. Who asks the wind to be the fanner of fire ( lt. the devourer of the sacrificial offerings)?&#xA;(22.) With the words &amp;ldquo;so be it&amp;rdquo;, the God of love received on his head his master&amp;rsquo;s command, like a garland offered as a gift of favour, and started ; and Indra touched his body (as a mark of special grace) with his hand grown rough by stroking the Airàvata (for encouragement).&#xA;(23.) He went to the Himalayan resort of Sthânu (S′iva) followed by Màdhava, his dear friend, and by Rati with apprehension, determined to effect the work even at the cost of his body.&#xA;(24.) In that forest Madhu ( the vernal season) manifested himself having assumed his proper form, which was an object of pride to the mind-born One (Kâma), acting antagonistically to the performance of austerities of the sages practising self-restraint.&#xA;(25.) When the hot-rayed one (sun) began to go towards the quarter guarded by Kubera (the North) out of the proper season, the Southern quarter sent forth wind from her mouth like a sigh of anguish,&#xA;(:17 )&#xA;(Side-meaning.) A certain&#xA;kind-hearted damsel&#xA;heaved out a sigh of pain from her mouth, when her lover, an adventurous gallant, started to go to another woman, kept by some deformed person, having broken the engagement with her.&#xA;(26.) Then the As&amp;rsquo;oka tree put forth at once flowers together with foliage just from its stem and did not wait for a touch from the feet of the fair jingling with anklets.&#xA;(27.) The Vernal Season having fitted up the arrow (of Káma) in the shape of the young mango blossom with fresh leaves as its feathers, inscribed on it, as it were, the name of the Mind-born in the shape of the bees.&#xA;(28.) The Karnikára flower, though of gorgeous tints, pains the mind by its odourlessness; generally the mind of the Creator of the world is averse to bestowing completeness of qualities on a thing.&#xA;(29.) The Palas&amp;rsquo;a buds, extremely red and curved like the young moon, not being blossomed, shone like red marks of nails on (the persons of) the Forest-sites then united with the Vernal Season (their lover).&#xA;(30.) The Vernal Beauty having displayed on her fore head a Tilaka (the tilaka flower) artistically painted with black pigment in the shape of the bees that swarmed over it, ornamented her lip of the young mango leaf with a red tint (red lac) mellow like the light of the morning sun.&#xA;(31.) The fawns with their eyes blinded by the pollendust of the blossom of the Piyàla trees and intoxicated with passion, ran wildly against the wind in the forest glades, full of the murmur of falling leaves.&#xA;(32.) What strain of music was warbled out by the male Cuckoo, whose neck was red (or, whose voice was impassioned) by his feasting on the mango sprouts, became the mandate of Smara competent to break down the pride of high-minded dames.&#xA;(33.) Perspiration made its appearance on the ornamental paintings (on the persons) of the Kinnara ladies, the complexion of whose faces was slightly yellow and whose&#xA;( 18 )&#xA;lips looked bright (not being smeared with wax or, after Malli.-were free from pain), owing to the passing away of the wintry season.&#xA;(34.) The ascetics, living in the forest of S&amp;rsquo;iva (lit. the immovable one), seeing the untimely manifestation of spring could, with difficulty, be masters of their minds whose perturbation was curbed with (great) effort.&#xA;(35.) When Madana reached that region, with Rati as his companion, and his flower-bow strung, all living things forming themselves into pairs manifested by their actions amorous feeling pervaded by the sentiment of love gone to&#xA;excess.&#xA;(36.) The male bee, attentive to (according to Malli., following) his dear mate, drank honey from the same flower-bowl; and the black antelope scratched with his horn his female who had closed her eyes through the pleasant sensation caused by that touch.&#xA;(37.) The female elephant, through great love, gave to the male the water held in her mouth, fragrant with the pollen-dust of lotuses. The Chakrawâka (lit. having the name of the member of a chariot) flattered his hen by giving her a lotus-stalk half eaten (by himself).&#xA;(38.) The Kimpurusha, in the intervals of music, kissed his beloved&amp;rsquo;s face with the eyes attractive by rolling through intoxication caused by the floral wine, and having its paintings a little disfigured (lit. loosened) by the drops of perspi - ration brought on by exertion.&#xA;(39.) The trees even received close clasps from the arms, in the shape of tender twigs, of the creeper-wives, captivating with throbbing lips in the shape of young reddish sprouts and with breasts of the full clusters of flowers.&#xA;(40.) Hara, though hearing the music of the heavenly damsels at such a time, remained absorbed in meditation; for never can &amp;ldquo;obstacles break the Samàdhi ( disturb the contemplation) of those who have complete control over themselves.( 19 )&#xA;(41.) Then Nandi, standing at the entrance of the creeper-bower, with a gold staff resting against his left forearm, checked the Ganas, ordering them not to be mischievous by a sign of his forefinger placed on the mouth.&#xA;(42.) And at his bidding the whole forest itself stood with its movements committed to a painting as it were, the trees having ceased waving about, the swarms of bees having remained still, the birds having withheld their music, and the beasts having stopped roaming.&#xA;(43.) Having avoided his glance, as one does the quarter wherein shines Venus, when starting on a journey, Kâma entered S&amp;rsquo;iva&amp;rsquo;s abode of contemplation, screened with the thickly interwoven branches of the Nameru trees all round.&#xA;(44.) He, the fall (destruction) of whose body was at hand, saw the Three-eyed God, absorbed in ascetic contemplation, seated on an altar of the Devadáru tree, covered over with a tiger&amp;rsquo;s skin.&#xA;(45.) The fore-part of whose body was steady owing to the posture called Virâsana, who was sitting straight and fully drawn, both of whose shoulders were a little bent, and in whose lap there lay as it&#xA;as it were a full blown lotus, owing to his two hands being placed there with the palms turned upwards.&#xA;(46.) The mass of whose matted hair was gathered upwards and tied with a serpent, who had a double string of Rudrakshas hanging down from his ears, and who wore a black antelope&amp;rsquo;s hide with knots, appearing still more darkish on account of the complexion of his neck;&#xA;(47.) Who was looking steadfastly at (the tip of) his nose with his eyes, the fierce pupils of which were motionless and shining out a little, and which had desisted from the habit of kniting the brows, the thick lashes of which were not moving and the vision of which was turned downwards;&#xA;(48.) Who, on account of the suspension of the vital airs (lit. the airs moving inside), appeared like a cloud not&#xA;(20)&#xA;blustering up to burst into a shower, or like a reservoir of water unruffled with ripples or like a lamp (burning) steady In a place free from wind;&#xA;(49.) Who was putting into shade the grace softer than that of the lotus fibres, of the young moon, by the rays of light shooting forth from the head, having got a passage through the eye in the cranium;&#xA;(50.) Who, having fixed in his heart the mind, with its operations through the nine gates (of sense) entirely suspended and completely under the influence of concentration, was realising in himself his own self, whom the seers call the Eternal.&#xA;(51.) Smara (Cupid), while looking at him, the threeeyed one, not to be assailed even in thought, in that posture, his hand drooping through fear, did not notice the bow and arrow dropped down from his hand.&#xA;(52.) Just then was seen the daughter of the Lord of immovables (Himalaya) accompanied by the sylvan deities, reviving, as it were, his prowess, almost deadened, by the beauty of her person;&#xA;(53.) Who wore a decoration of the spring flowers, the Asoka flowers in which put into shade the rubies, the Karnika ras bore the lustre of gold and the Sindhuvaras shone like a necklace of pearls;&#xA;(54.) Who stooped a little with (the weight) of her breasts, and wore a garment of the hue of the morning sun› thus-looking like a walking creeper covered with folige and bending under the breast-like clusters of flowers;&#xA;(55.) Who was drawing up with her hand again and again the zone, composed of Bakula flowers, slipping down her hips, which was, as it were, a second string for his bow deposited there by Smara who knew the appropriate place for it;&#xA;(56.) And who, her eyes agitated through confusion, was keeping off, every moment, with a sportive lotus, a bee hovering round her Bimba-like nether lip, with its thirst (desire) excited by her fragrant breath.&#xA;(57.) On seeing her, faultless in all her limbs, and a standing shame even to Rati, the flower-arrowed god again&#xA;(21)&#xA;hoped for the accomplishment of his object respecting the Trident-holder who had conquered his senses.&#xA;(58.) Uma&amp;rsquo; approached the entrance (of the abode ) of S&amp;rsquo;ambhu, her future lord; and at the same time, he too, having realised in himself the eternal light called Parma&amp;rsquo;tman desisted from contemplation (broke the Sama&amp;rsquo;dhi).&#xA;(59.) Then the Lord, slowly releasing all the vital airs in the body, the portion of the earth under him being, with great difficulty, upborne with the tops of his hoods by the lord of serpents, loosened the firm Vira&amp;rsquo;sana.&#xA;(60.)&#xA;To him, Nandi, having saluted, announced the coming of the daughter of the Mountain-lord through the desire of waiting upon him, and ushered her into the presence of his lord, her admittance being permitted with a mere sign of the eye-brow.&#xA;(61.) By her two friends was scattered a collection of spring-flowers, mixed with bits of leaves gathered with their own hands, at the feet of the Three-eyed God, with a bow.&#xA;(62.)&#xA;Umà made a bow to the Bull-emblemed God with her head, when the tender leaf on the ear dropped down and the fresh Karinka&amp;rsquo;ra flowers shining in the midst of her black tresses got loosened.&#xA;(63.)&#xA;C&#xA;She was indeed told the truth by Bhava when he said do yoge t a husband, who will not attend to another woman: the words of the mighty do not foster a sense contrary to their meaning in this world.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;}&#xA;(64.) Kama, having seized this as the proper opportunity for (discharging) his arrow, being as if desirous of entering the fire like a moth, touched again and again the string of his bow, having fixed his eye on Hara, while Uma stood hard by (lit. in the presence of Uma&amp;rsquo;).&#xA;釁&#xA;(65.) Then Gauri offered to Girisha, given to asceticism, a rosary of the seeds of lotuses grown in the Manda&amp;rsquo;kini and dried up by the rays of the sun, with a hand of a rosy colour.&#xA;(22)&#xA;(66.) The three-eyed God through love for devotees made ready to take that rosary, and the very moment the flower-arrowed God placed on the bow his unfailing arrow called Sammohana (the captivator).&#xA;(67.) Hara, his firmness a little shaken, as is the sea (agitated) at the rising of the moon, cast his eyes on Uma&amp;rsquo;s face, the lower lip of which was like the Bimba fruit.&#xA;(68.) The daughter of the Mountain too, betraying her emotion by limbs that looked like the blooming Kadamba flowers (on account of the hair standing on end), stood with a half averted face, lovelier still and with the eyes agitated through shyness.&#xA;(69.) Then S&amp;rsquo;iva, having strongly restrained the perturbation of his senses by means of his (perfect) self-control, and desiring to find out the cause of the disturbance of his heart, directed his eye towards the directions.&#xA;(70.)&#xA;Then he saw the mind-born one, his clenched fist resting on the corner of his left eye, his shoulders bent (forward) and his left foot drawn in, ready to strike with his beautiful bow stretched to (the figure of) a circle.&#xA;(71.) All at once a blazing fire with rising flames sprang from the third eye of him, whose ire was roused by the disturbance to his austerities, and whose face was terrible to look at owing to the knitting of the eye-brows&#xA;(72.) Ere the cries of the gods-&amp;ldquo;Restrain thy ire, restrain thy ire, O Lord&amp;rdquo;-could rise in the sky, the fire, born of the eye of Bhava, left only the ashes of Madana.&#xA;(73.) And Rati, who for a time stood unconscious of the death of her husband, had a favour conferred upon her as it were by the swoon, which, occasioned by the sharp discomfiture, stifled all operations of her senses.&#xA;(74.) Having quickly destroyed him, the obstacle to his austerities, as the bolt of Indra does a tree, the Great ascetic, the Lord of beings, together with his followers, vanished from sight, in order to avoid the vicinity of women.&#xA;(28)&#xA;(75.) The daughter of the Mountain knowing the desire of her exalted father as well as her lovely body to be vain, overwhelmed with shame all the more, because it happened in the presence of her two friends, somehow or other went homeward, like one dazed.&#xA;(76.) Just then the Mountain, having taken into his arms his daughter who deserved to be sympathised with and who had closed her eyes in fear of the anger of Bhava, went along the path, as does the elephant of the gods holding a lotus sticking to his tusk, with his body stretched to its full length on account of his great speed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(1.) Then the wife of Káma, who was beside herself, being entirely in the power of the trance, was awakened by Destiny, wishing to make her experience new widowhood with its unbearable pangs.&#xA;(2.) She made her eyes, opened at the close of the swoon, gaze attentively, but she did not know that the sight of her dear lord was for ever lost to her never-satiated eyes.&#xA;*&#xA;(3.) O Lord of my life, art thou alive,&amp;quot; so saying she got up; but she saw on the ground, merely a heap of ashes, In a man&amp;rsquo;s shape, due to the fire of the anger of Hara.&#xA;(4.) Then she, again distracted (with grief), her breasts dusty from the touch of the ground, and her hair dishevelled, wailed, as if making the region (the living creatures) share her grief (lit. equally miserable).&#xA;(5.) Thy body, which served as a sample for all amor ous persons by its resplendency (handsomeness), has been reduced to this condition, and yet I do not burst through grief! Hard-hearted, indeed, must be women!&#xA;(6.) Where hast thou fled, abruptly leaving me whose (very) life depends upon thee, forgetting thy love in a moment, as does a torrent of water throwing up a lotus after breaking down a dam ?&#xA;(24)&#xA;(7.) Thou hast never done anything that would displease me, nor have I ever acted contrary to thy wishes: why is it, then, that, without cause, thou dost not present a sight of thee to thy Rati who is lamenting (thy loss)?&#xA;(8.) Dost thou remember, O Smara, my binding thee with the strings of my waist band whenever I was addressed with a wrong name by thee, or my beatings of thee with lotuses used as ear ornaments, hurting thy eyes with pollen-dust dropping from them?&#xA;(9.) I know the speech which thou wouldst utter to please me-vir.&amp;quot; thou dwellest in my heart &amp;ldquo;. -to be false; if it was not an empty compliment, how is it that thou art without a body, and Rati uninjured?&#xA;(10.)&#xA;I will follow the path of thee who hast started on a new journey to the other world; but this world is cheated (of its pleasure) by Vidhi: the happiness of embodied beings does, indeed, depend on thee.&#xA;(11.)&#xA;Who else but thee, O beloved, can enable the sweet-hearts terrified by the thunder of the clouds, to reach the houses of their lovers, when the roads of the cities are shrouded in nocturnal darkness?&#xA;(12.) The intoxication of the young damsels by wine is now a mockery when thou hast ceased to exist-the intoxication that makes the red eyes roll (from side to side) and the words falter at every step.&#xA;(13.) O bodiless one, the Moon, knowing that the body of thee, his dear friend, has become a subject-matter of tales (only) and that his appearance (in the sky) useless, will, with great relutance, give up his thinness, even when the dark half has passed away.&#xA;(14.) Say by whom will the fresh blossom of the mango tree, the beautiful stem of which is reddish green and the sprouting of which is proclaimed by the notes of the malecuckoo, be used as his arrow?&#xA;(15.) The swarm of bees, which was many a time used as a string for thy bow by thee, seems by its huminings,&#xA;( 25 )&#xA;in piteous tones, as if to-sympathise with me, whose distress&#xA;1s great.&#xA;(16.)&#xA;Rise again, recovering thy graceful form, and once more appoint the koel, naturally clever in sweet (pers:5sive) talk, to the post of a messenger in love&#xA;(17.) There is no peace for me, O Smara, remembering as I do, our secret sportings, so familiar to us, and embracings, accompanied by tremour, solicited by bowing down the head.&#xA;(18.)&#xA;O thou expert in love-matters, here I bear on my person the vernal decoration of flowers arranged by thyself, but that beautiful body of thine is not to be seen.&#xA;19 Come then, and finish the colouring of my left loot, lit. other than the right one) before finishing the decoration of which, thou wast (called away by being) remembered by the cruel gods.&#xA;(20.) As long as thou art not deceived (into loving them) in heaven, O dear, by the artful damsels of heaven, I will come to sit once more on thy lap, following thee by the way of locusts (burning myself on the funeral pyre).&#xA;(21.) beloved, though I follow thee, this reproach will sand-that I, Rati, bereaved of Madana, lived (hough) for a moment only.&#xA;(22.) How can the last decorations be done by me for thee, who hast gone to another world? For thou hast been reduced to an unthought-of condition by simultaneously (losing) both thy life and body.&#xA;(23.) I remember thy merry talk (lit. accompanied with Smiles) with, and casting a side-glance (lit. looking from the cornor of the eyes) at Madhu, as thou wast straightening the arrow, with the bow stationed on thy lap.&#xA;(24.) Where is thy friend, Madhu, the delight of thy heart, who shaped thy bow with flowers? Ör alas, can it be that he, too, is sent along the path taken by his friend by the Trident-holder whose wrath is dreadful?&#xA;(25.) Madhu, cut at heart by her cries of woe, as by venomed arrows, discovered himself in the front of the woestriken Kati to console her.&#xA;K. T. 3&#xA;( 26 )&#xA;(26.) On seeing him she wept bitterly and beat her bosom so as to oppress her breasts; misery breaks out as if opening her flood-gates in the presence of one&amp;rsquo;s connections (a Kinsman or a friend).&#xA;(27.) Smitten with grief she thus said to him-Look, O Vasanta, what has remained of thy friend. These ashes, variegated like a pigeon, are blown about, particle by particle, by the wind.&#xA;(28.)&#xA;Now reveal thyself to us, O Smara. This Màdhava longs to behold thee; the love of men may be fickle to women, but it can not be so towards a friend.&#xA;(29.) By this thy comrade (lit. one who is always by the side) the whole world, including the gods and the demons, is forced to own the empire of thy bow, the string of which is the lotus-fibre, and the arrows delicate flowers.&#xA;30 Gone is that friend of thine; he comes not back, as a lamp put out by the blast of wind; I am as it were the wick (of this lamp); behold me enveloped in the smoke of unbearable misery.&#xA;(31.) Fate, sparing me while killing Káma, has only done half the butchery; when the firm supporting tree is broken by an elephant the creeper (hanging by it) tends (is bound) to come down.&#xA;(32.) Therefore let this duty by a friend, which comes next, be done by thee; pray, send me, who am afflicted, to my husband, by consigning me to the funeral fire.&#xA;(33.) The moon-light passes away with the moon, and the lightning vanishes with the clouds; that a wife has to go by the way the husband has gone is thus admitted even by life-less things.&#xA;(34.) Besmearing my breasts with these ashes of the body of my beloved, I shall lay my body on the fire as if on a bed of young leaves.&#xA;(35.) O gentle one, thou hast many a time helped making up our bed of flowers; do thou now pile up a pyre quickly, urged to do so with a bow with joined palms.&#xA;(36.) After that, coax the fire set to me by fannings in the shape of the south winds that it should burn quickly;&#xA;( 27 )&#xA;it is indeed known to thee that Smara can not bear to live&#xA;without me even for a moment.&#xA;(37.) Having done so, offer one handful of water for us two; that thy friend, together with me, will drink undivided in the other world.&#xA;(38.) On Mádhava, in the ceremony after-death for Smara offer the spray of mango blossom, the leaves of which are tremulous; for the mango blossom was dear to thy friend.&#xA;(39.) A speech, breathed in the sky, comforted Rati, thus prepared to abandon her life; as does the first shower comfort a fish distressed by the drying up of a pond.&#xA;(40.) thou, wife of the flower-weaponed god, thy husband shall not be long unobtainable to thee: listen how he came to the plight of a locust in the flame of the fire (sprung) from the eye of Hara.&#xA;(41.) Prajapati (the lord of creation) felt a lustful desire. for his own daughter, his senses being excited by Kâma ; he, then, having curbed the excitement, cursed Káma, who has thus experienced the fruit (of his own act).&#xA;(42.)&#xA;When Hara, made to look upon her with favour by her austerities, will lead Parvati to the altar, then having got back his own bliss, he will unite Smara again with his form.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;(43.) Thus did god Brahmâ, when begged by Dharma, deliver a speech setting forth a limit to Smara&amp;rsquo;s curse: the self-restrained and the clouds are the sources of both. Ashani and Amrit lightning and water (curses and favours ;).&#xA;(44.) So, O sweet woman, preserve this body which will be reunited with thy husband: a river, the water of which is drunk up by the sun, is again joined with a fresh current in the rainy season.&#xA;(45.) Thus did some being of unseen form discourage Rati&amp;rsquo;s idea of seeking her death, and through a belief in that the friend of the flower-weaponed god) (voice) spring (lit), consoled her with words (replete with good sense).&#xA;(46.) Then the wife of Madana lived, (thinned by her misery), awaiting the end of the calamity just as the crescent of the moon appearing by day and looking pale through the loss of rays, awaits the (coming of the) evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(1.) Parvati, bathed in her hopes by the Trident-holde: burning, in that manner, the mind-born deity in her presence, cursed her beauty in her heart. for beauty has for its guerdon good fortune as regards (the being liked by) one&amp;rsquo;s beloved.&#xA;(2.) She wished to make her beauty fruitful by austeritles, having recourse to concentration; how else, could she secure the two things such love and a husband of that kind.&#xA;3 Mená, hearing that her daughter, who had set her heart on Girisá, was resolved to practise penance, clasped her to her bosom, and spoke dissuading ber from the difficult practice of asceticism&#xA;(4.) In the house are deities such as the heart would desire what a wide difference is there between austerities and thy body The delicate S&amp;rsquo;irisha flower can bear the tread of a bee but not that of a bird&#xA;(5.) Menâ, though thus exhorting her daughter, whose desire was Inflexible, could not dissuade her from her resolve: who can make a mind firm in its resolution to achieve a desired object or turn back water (rushing) towards a low ground.&#xA;On one occasion that steady-minded girl, begged of her father, who knew her desire, a residence (permission to dwell) in the forest to perform religious austerities till their fruition, through a friend who was her confidante.&#xA;(7.) Being granted permission by her great father, delighted in a persistence worthy of her, she repaired to a peak, full of peacocks, which came to be known by her na ne ever afterwards among the people.&#xA;She, of never-to-be shaken disposition, having given u; her necklace, which rubbed away the sandal paste (or her breast) by its threads, wore a bark garment, tawny like the morning sun, the close union of which with the buds was 1 revented by the elevated breasts.(29)&#xA;(9.) As her face looked pretty by her decorated tresses so it did by the matted hair also; a lotus does not look beautiful only by the swarms of bees but even by its union with moss.&#xA;(10.) By that string of Munja grass having three threads, which she wore for her penance and which (by its harsh touch) caused her hair to stand erect every moment, was the place of the waistband made red, being fastened there for the first time on that occasion.&#xA;…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;…&#xA;(4.) Illumining the sky with the circles of their lustre, the great sages (lit. those whose penance was their treasure) immediately appeared before the Lord, accompanied by Arundhati.&#xA;(5.) Bathed in the streams of the celestial Ganges, the waves of which bear along the flowers of the wish-granting trees grown on the banks and which are scented with the temporal juice of the quarter-elephants;&#xA;(6.) Wearing sacred threads of pearls, dressed in gold bark-garments and having jewel-rosaries and (thus) looking like the heavenly trees that had betaken to the ascetic mode of life (retirement from the world);&#xA;(7.) Who were looked up to with a bow by the thousandrayed (sun) himself having placed his horses below and bent his flag;&#xA;(8.) Who had rested, at the time of the calamity of universal destruction, on the tusk of the great Boar along with the earth, that was lifted up (from water), with their creeper-like arms attached to it (the tusk or the earth);&#xA;(9.) Who, on account of their finishing the work of the remaining part of the creation, after Brahman, are&#xA;(40)&#xA;mentioned ( described by those conversant with history) as the primeval creators;&#xA;(10.) And who, although enjoying the fruits of their exceedingly pure penance, practised in previous lives and now come to fruition, remalned (continued to be) ascetics still.&#xA;(11.)&#xA;The chaste Arundhati who was in their midst with her eyes directed to the feet of her husband, shone exceedingly as though she were the success of their asceticism incarnate.&#xA;(12.) The Lord looked upon (or, received) her and the sages without any distinction of honour; no regard is shown to one&amp;rsquo;s being a male or female; for the character of the good (alone) is esteemed.&#xA;(13.) At her sight S&amp;rsquo;ambhu&amp;rsquo;s desire for a wife became stronger: good wives, indeed, are the prime cause of religious performances.&#xA;(14.) Religious duty having made S&amp;rsquo;iva take a step. with regard to (form a regard for) Parvati, the mind of Kâma, full of fear at previous guilt, breathed with relief (or hope).&#xA;(15.) Then all those sages, who were adepts in the Vedas with their accessory branches, having duly honoured the Lord of the universe (thus) spoke to Him, with the hair of their bodies standing on end from joy.&#xA;(16.) The Veda that was duly studied by us; the sacrifices that were offered into the fire in the prescribed form and the penance that was practised-the fruit of all that has been ripened for us to-day,&#xA;(17.)—in as much as by thee, Lord over all the worlds, we have been made to be the object of thy mind which is - beyond the reach of our wish.&#xA;(18.) He, in whose mind thou abidest, is, indeed, the greatest of all blessed persons: what then to say of him: who dwells in the mind of thee, the cause of Brahma (or the Vedas)?&#xA;(19.)&#xA;(41)&#xA;Truly we occupy a station higher than that of the sun and the moon; but to-day far higher than theirs, owing to the favour of thy remembrance of us.&#xA;(20.)&#xA;We think highly of ourselves (thus) honoured by thee: generally the regard of superiors creates confidence in one&amp;rsquo;s own merits.&#xA;(21.)&#xA;Where is the necessity, O Thou with diverse eyes, to express to Thee the delight caused to us by thy having remembered us! Thou art the in-dwelling soul of all embodied creatures.&#xA;(22.)&#xA;Thou art seen visibly, and yet we know thee not in thy real nature; be pleased and explain thyself: (for) Thou liest not within the range of mental faculties.&#xA;(23.) Which (of the three) is this form of thine? whether that by which Thou manifestest the universe or that by which Thou preservest it or that which resolves the universe back (into its original state).&#xA;(24.) Or rather, O God, let this our high-soaring request stand aside: in the first place command us who have presented ourselves at thy mental call. What shall we do?&#xA;(25.) Then the great the scanty lustre of the&#xA;-rays of his teeth.&#xA;God spoke to them, heightening moon on his head with the bright&#xA;(26.) It is known to you that none of my proceedings (efforts, activities) are for my own self: and verily I am shown to be of such nature by my eight forms.&#xA;(27.) That I (or, I who am, such) have been solicited for progeny (to beget a son) by the gods tormented by their enemies as the (lightning-bearing) cloud is for a shower by the Chátaka birds oppressed by thirst.&#xA;(28.) For this reason I wish to take (for wife) Pârvatf for (begetting) a son, as a sacrificer secures arani (particular pieces of wood) for the generation of the holy fire.&#xA;( 42 )&#xA;(29.) Himalaya should be requested by you to bestow her (in marriage) on me: the connections (relationship) brought about by the good do not lead to bad results.&#xA;(30.) Know me also to be not deluded, being joined in relationship with him who is exalted (lofty), who keeps within proper bounds (has stability), and who bears the burden of the earth.&#xA;(31.) That he should be addressed in such and such a way for his daughter need not be told to you; for the learned inculcate the rules of conduct prescribed by yourselves.&#xA;(32.) The revered Arundhati too will do well to take part therein generally in a matter of this nature matrons have great competency.&#xA;(33.) Set out then for Oshadhiprastha, the city (capital) of Himalaya, for the accomplishment (of the business); we shall meet again just at this cataract of the Mahákosf.&#xA;(34.) When he, the foremost of ascetics, became inclined to marriage, the ascetics, born of Brahman, gave up their shame for having wives.&#xA;(35.) Then having said &amp;lsquo;very well&amp;rsquo; the group of sages departed. And the Lord also went to the place first settled.&#xA;(36.) The great sages too, having jumped into the sky, dark like a sword, and equalling the mind in velocity, reached Oshadhiprastha,&#xA;(37.) (The city) which was built as it were, by transplanting, Alaká itself, the repository of wealth and abundance (or, abundant wealth) and peopled, as it were, by causing an exodus of the redundance of heaven.&#xA;(38.) Which was encircled by the streams of the Ganges, which had herbs blazing within its ramparts, the wall of which was built of large jewel-stones and which was charming even in (notwithstanding) Its fortifications.&#xA;(39.) Wherein the elephants had overcome their fear of llons, where the horses were of the Bila-breed, and of&#xA;(43)&#xA;which the Yakshas and the Kimpurushas were the male citizens and the sylvan goddesses the females.&#xA;(40.) In which the sounds of tabors in the houses, the tops of which have clouds clinging to them, being confounded with the echoes of the thunderclaps, are distinguished by the strokes accompanying them.&#xA;(41.) Where the beauty of flags of the staves in houses is presented (given rise to ), without any attempt on the part of the citizens, by the desire-granting trees themselves, having garments fluttering on their branches.&#xA;(42.) Where in the parts of the crystal mansions (set apart) for drinking, the reflections of stars get at night to the position of (serve as ) presents (or offerings) of flowers.&#xA;(43.) Where at night, amorous females going out to meet their lovers are ignorant of ( do not experience) nocturnal darkness even on cloudy days, their paths being shown by the light of the (glittering) herbs.&#xA;(44.) Wherein life extended to youth (only; or youth was the last stage of life); where no other destroyer was known than the flower-arrowed-god and where sleep brought on by sexual exhaustion was (the only) suspension of sensation.&#xA;(45.) In which lovers are made supplicants, till favour is shown (reconciliation) by the (jealous) anger of beloveds, in which there are contractions of the eye-brows, quiverings of lips and threatenings with graceful fingers.&#xA;(46.) Whose outer garden is the fragrant Gandhamàdana, in which the Vidyàdhara travellers sleep in the shades of the Santanaka (heavenly) trees.&#xA;(47.) Now the divine sages on seeing the capital of Him, thought their performance of holy rites with the object of attaining heaven to be a deception.&#xA;(48.) Looked at by the door-keepers with faces raised up, they, with the masses of their matted hair steady like&#xA;( 44 )&#xA;painted (flames of) fire, descended with speed into the palace of the mountain,&#xA;(49.) The row of sages alighted from the sky, with the seniors preceding in due order, shone like a series of the reflections of the sun in water.&#xA;(50.) Bending the earth by the plantings of his feet heavy with inward substance, the mountain, taking the materials of worship, advanced from a distance to receive them, worthy of adoration,&#xA;(51.) With lips mineral-red (having red minerals for his ruddy lips), tall, with arms huge like fir trees (having the large fir trees for his arms), and with a chest strong like a rock (having rocks for his chest) he was clearly known to be Himayat.&#xA;(52.) Himself leading the way, he made them, to whom reception was accorded in the due form and who were of holy practices, enter the barem.&#xA;(53.) Having taken his seat the lord of mountains, with joined palms, addressed this speech to the divine (lit. powerful) sages who were already seated in cane seats.&#xA;(54.) Your sight obtained unexpectedly appears to me like shower without the (previous) rise of clouds or like a fruit without the appearance of a flower (before-hand).&#xA;(55.) By(this) your favour I consider myself like one enlightened being ignorant, or as if transformed into gold being made of Iron, or as if raised to heaven from earth.&#xA;(56.) From this day I am to be approached for purification by creatures; for that which is resorted to by the adorable is called a holy (purifying) place.&#xA;(57.) O you, the most eminent of the twice born ( Brahmanas), I consider myself sanctified by the two only, the fall of the Ganges on my head and by the water from your washed feet.&#xA;( 45 )&#xA;I consider even my two-fold body, as separately favoured: the movable by being in the position of your servant, the immovable by being marked by your feet.&#xA;(59.) My limbs though spreading to ( covering all space within the extremities of quarters are ill sufficient to contain the growing joy, caused by the honour done by you.&#xA;(60.) By the sight of you, resplendent (illustrious) ones, not only the darkness in my caves is removed but even my internal darkness (ignorance), lying beyond. Rajas (the quality of passiou) is dispelled.&#xA;(61.) I do not see that there is any thing to be done for you; and if there be any, what is there that cannot be expected to be accomplished by you? I think your arrival here is simply for my purification.&#xA;(62.) Still be pleased to give me a command in some matter (to do something for you): for, in respect of their masters servants consider an order as a favour.&#xA;(63.) My own self, my wife here; and this my daughter, the life of your family: say which of us you want to be at your service: about external things I speak not with any regard, (no need to say that they will be at your service):&#xA;(64.) Himalaya, who spoke thus, said the same thing twice as it were, by its echo resounding from the mouths of the caverns.&#xA;(65.) Thereupon the sages urged Angiras, best skilled (lit. the foremost speaker) in matters to be spoken, to speak: he replied (thus) to the mountain-&#xA;(66.) All this (that you have said) is befitting to you and even more; the loftiness of your mind and of your peaks is alike.&#xA;(67.) Rightly are you called Vishnu in your immovable form: for your middle ( or interior) has become the support of all beings-movable and immovable.&#xA;( 46 )&#xA;(68.) How could the Serpent have borne the earth on hoods as delicate as lotus-stalks, had you not sustained it from the bottom of the nether world ̧!&#xA;(69.) Your glories and your rivers, with their currents unbroken and untainted and unobstructed by the waves of the seas, purify the worlds owing to their sanctity.&#xA;(70.) Just as Gangà is lauded by (her birth from) the foot of the supreme Lord, so she is by you of lofty peaks, her second source.&#xA;(71.) The greatness of Harf pervaded all space, crosswise upwards and downwards, when attempting to take the three steps: with you it is natural.&#xA;(72.) By you having got a place among those enjoying a share of the sacrificial food, the lofty golden peak of Meru is rendered futile ( made of less consequence ).&#xA;(73.) All hardness has been transferred by you to your immovable form. But this your animate form, given to the propitiation of the good, is humble (lit. beut low) with devotion.&#xA;(74.) Hear then the business which has brought us here: it is, however, your own business.&#xA;But we are participators in this by our advising in auspicious matters (in as much as we have to advise you in what is to your benefit).&#xA;(75.) He, who bears, along with the crescent moon, the sublime title of &amp;lsquo;Lord&amp;rsquo;, endowed with the attributes animan (the power to become atomic) and others and not applying to any other person;&#xA;(76.) By whom is sustained this universe by means of his forms, earth and others, adding to one another&amp;rsquo;s power, as a carriage is held by horses on the road;&#xA;(77.) Whom residing in the interior of the body (the heart) ascetics seek, and whose abode, the wise declare, is free from the fear of the recurrence of birth ;&#xA;( 47 )&#xA;(78.) That S&amp;rsquo;ambhu himself, the witness of the doings of the world and the giver of desired objects, asks for your daughter through (lit. by words addressed through) us.&#xA;(79.) You will then do well to unite him with your daughter like sense with words: for a daughter given to a good husband is not to be regretted by (is no matter of regret for) the father.&#xA;(80.) Let all these creatures, immovable and movableas many as they are-consider her their mother; for S&amp;rsquo;iva Is the father of the universe.&#xA;(81.) Let the gods, after having bowed down to the dark-necked God, tinge her feet with the rays of their crest-jewels.&#xA;(82.) Uma is the bride; you, her giver in marriage; and here are we solicitors (for her); and S&amp;rsquo;ambhu is the bridegroom: this combination (of circumstances) is enough for the exaltation of your family.&#xA;(83.) By forming the alliance through your daughter, be the father of the father of the universe, who does not praise any one, but is praised by all, who adores none but is adored by all.&#xA;(84.) While the sage was speaking thus, Párvatt, who was by her father&amp;rsquo;s side, counted the petals of her sportive lotus with a down-cast look.&#xA;(85.) The mountain, though his desire was entirely fulfilled, looked up to the face of Mená: generally in matters relating to daughters householders are guided by their wives (lit. have wives for their guiding eyes).&#xA;(86.) Mena&amp;rsquo;, too, approved of all that, the much desired object of her husband. Wives devoted to their husbands never disagree with their lords in their desired objects.&#xA;(87.) He, having thought in his mind after reflection&amp;rsquo;this would be the proper reply to this&amp;rsquo;-took hold of his daughter, auspiciously adorned, at the conclusion of the (sage&amp;rsquo;s) speech-&#xA;(48)&#xA;(88.) Come on, dear daughter: thou art made alms to S&amp;rsquo;iva (the soul of the universe). The sages are the petitioners : I have obtained the frult of a householder&amp;rsquo;s (or, married) life.&#xA;(89.) Having said so much to his daughter, the moun tain said to the sages-here bows to you all the bride of the three-eyed God.&#xA;(90.) Having commended the speech of the mountain, noble on account of his acting up to their wishes, they (the sages ) magnified Ambikâ with benedictions that were soon to fructify.&#xA;(91.) Arundhati placed on her lap that blushing girl whose two gold ear-rings slipped off in her hurry (lit. earnest desire) to make a bow.&#xA;(92.) And by (mentioning) the virtues of the bridegroom who had no other wife beforehand, she consoled her mother whose face was suffused with tears, and who was distracted on account of her affection for her daughter.&#xA;(93.) Asked the very moment, as for the auspicious) day for marriage, by Siva&amp;rsquo;s (future) kinsman, the barkclothed sages, saying that that would be after three days thence, departed.&#xA;(94.) Having taken leave of Himalaya and returned to S&amp;rsquo;iva they told him that their mission was succesful and being dismissed by him flew up into the sky.&#xA;(95.) The Lord of creatures, too, eager for the union with the mountain&amp;rsquo;s daughter, passed those days with difficulty. Whom else under the power of senses will not these feelings (mental conditions) distract when they affect even the Almighty?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(1.) Then (after the settling of the wedding-day) in the waxing (fortnight) of the lord of herbs, on the day endowed with the virtue (auspiciousness) of the Jamitra ( seventh position from the zodiacal sign fixed as auspicious for the marriage ), Himavat, with his relatives gathered, performed the ceremonies preliminary to the wedding of his daughter.&#xA;(2.) On account of the ladies being busily engaged, out of love, in every house, in getting up the auspicious things fit for the marriage ceremony, the city and the inner apartment of the mountain were comparable to (appeared to forni) one house.&#xA;(3.) The city, the high roads of which were strewed with heavenly flowers, the row of flags in which was made of China-silk and which was ablaze with the brilliance of its golden outer-gates, appeared as if it was heaven transplanted.&#xA;(4.) Although they had a number of chidren, Umâ alone, like one seen after a long time or like one revived after death, specially became the life of an object of special love to) her parents as she was about to be given away in marriage.&#xA;(5.) With a benediction pronounced (upon her every time ) she passed from lap to lap and enjoyed ornamentation after ornamentation: though shared by (different ) relatives the love of the mountain&amp;rsquo;s family was centred in her (lit. was focussed on that one object ).&#xA;was in&#xA;(6.) At the Muhurta (period of 48 minutes) auspi ciously presided over by the sun and when the moon conjunction with Uttaraphalgunf ( its twelfth mansion), the kinswomen with their husbands and male children living put decorations on her body.&#xA;(7.) She adorned the dress she put on for being smeared with oil (previous to bathing), the beauty of which was heightened by the tender sprouts of durva&amp;rsquo; mixed with white mustard seeds, in which a silk cloth was worn reaching be-&#xA;K. T. 5&#xA;( 50 )&#xA;yond the navel ( or, in which the silken cloth worn round the navel was removed ) and in which an arrow&#xA;(in the hand ).&#xA;was held&#xA;(8.) The maiden holding (lit. having come in contact with) the arrow ( to be held ) at the ceremony previous to the marriage rite, shone like the digit of the moon stimulated (waxing) by the ray of the sun, at the termination of the dark fortnight.&#xA;(9.)&#xA;The women conducted her, the oil applied to whose body was removed by the powder of Lodhra, whose person was besmeared with the slightly dry Káleya anguent (or saffron pigment) and who had worn a cloth flt for bathing. to the four-pillared saloon.&#xA;(10.) In it having a pavement of sapphire stones placed in it and variegated by being inlaid with ornamental rows of pearls, they bathed her, while the furyas sounded, with water poured out of gold pots.&#xA;1). Sle whose borly looked brighter by the auspicious. bath and who had put on a dress (lit. pair of bleached garments) fit for approaching the bridegroom, shone like the earth, that had received a washing from rain water and that had the Kâs&amp;rsquo;d flowers full-blown.&#xA;(12.) From that place she. being clasped, was condu cted by lulies devoted to their husbands to the middle of the auspicious altar which had a canopy and four pillars ( at its four corners } and which was provided with a seat.&#xA;(13.) Having seated the girl of a slender frame, facing the east on it, the ladies sitting before her with their eyes attracted by real ( unartificial ) beauty delayed for some time, though the articles of decoration were at hand.&#xA;(14.) One of the ladies tied the beautiful mass of her hair, the moisture of which was removed by the smoke of incense and which had flowers inside it with a garland of yellow Madhuka flowers (Bassia Latifolia) intermixed with durva grass so as to form a charming knot.&#xA;(15.) They (the ladies) applied white aloe paste to her body, and decorated it with ornamental paintings drawn with gororhana (yellow pigment ): she (thus) stood surpas-&#xA;(51)&#xA;sing the beauty of the three-coursed river (Ganges), the sandy banks of which are marked with the Chakraváka birds.&#xA;(16.) Excelling (the beauty of) the lotus with bees adhering to it or of the moon&amp;rsquo;s disk with streaks of clouds. the grace of her face (set off) by her decorated tresses occasion for (even) talk of comparison (or&#xA;left no equalisation).&#xA;(17.) The barley sprout placed on her ear, by its having attained excellence (as it hung) over her cheek rough with the besmearing of lodhra powder and excessively yellow with the paint of gerochana&amp;rsquo; (yellow pigment) arrested eyes (held rivetted upon it the eyes of the onlookers ).&#xA;(18.) The lower lip of her, with symmetrical limbs, parted by a line, (in the middle) the redness of which was heightened by a thin layer of wax, and which had the fruition of its loveliness uear, gave rise to an indescribable beauty by its throbbings.&#xA;(19.) When blessed by her friend after dying her feet (with lac dye ), jocosely saying-touch (strike) the digit of the moon on thy husband&amp;rsquo;s bead with this she struck her with a wreath of flowers without uttering a word.&#xA;(20.) The ladies decorating her, seeing that her eyes were as graceful as the petals of a lovely (lit. well grown) lotus, took up collyrium (for putting it into them) not because they thought it would add to their beauty, but because it was auspicious to do so.&#xA;(21.) As the ornaments were being put on her person she shone like a creeper with flowers springing up, like the night with stars rising therein, and like a river with birds (chakravakas) resorting thereto.&#xA;(22.) Observing her form looking magnificent (by the dress) in a mirror she, with her long eyes steady, became eager to approach S&amp;rsquo;iva: surely the dressing of women has for its fruit (object) the sight of (or its being seen by) their husbands.&#xA;23, 24. Then her mother Mená, taking with her two fingers the auspicious wet yellow orpiment and the red&#xA;( 52 )&#xA;arsenic and having raised her face, on the two ears of which hung two bright ear-rings, made with great difficulty the tilaka mark ( on the forehead of ), her daughter giving shape thereby just to the desire which rose in her mind for the first time, and which attained growth ( was intensified ) after the development of Umá&amp;rsquo;s bosom.&#xA;(25.) With her eyes filled with the tears of joy she also fastened the marriage-string of wool round her hand, which was misplaced but which was being pushed back (to the right place) by the nurse with her fingers.&#xA;(20.) She, clad in a fresh silk (white) garment and holding a new mirror appeared to great advantage, like the shore of the milky-ocean with a mass of foam on it. {{ like the autumnal ( moon-let) night with the moon.&#xA;(27.) The mother, expert in what was to be done (lit. what one should be made to do, on such an occasion) having made her, the main-stay (or glory) of the family, bow down to the worshipped tutelary deities, caused her to seize ( fall at ) the feet of chaste ladies in due order.&#xA;(28.) Do thou obtain the ever continuous (lit. unInterrupted or undivided) love of thy husband&amp;rsquo;-thus was Umá, bowing before them, spoken to (blessed) by them; but by her, sharing half of his body, the blessings of her loving relatives were outstripped.&#xA;(29.) The Mountain, well versed (in things to be done) and polite, having finished the ceremonies connected with her in a manner befitting (or proportionate to) his desire and wealth, sat in the reception hall attended by his friends awaiting the arrival of S&amp;rsquo;iva (the bull-emblemed God).&#xA;(30.) In the meantime, before Bhava, the destroyer of the cities, too, were placed, on Kubera&amp;rsquo;s mountain (Kailasa), the decorations suited to his marriage, the first of its kind, by the divine mothers diligenfly engaged (or, full of respect ).&#xA;(31.) Out of respect for them, the Lord simply touched that wealth of auspicious decorations: the very dress of the almighty God assumed the forms (of different decorations) desired by a bridegroom. Thus-&#xA;( 53 )&#xA;(32.) The ashes themselves became the white unguent for body, and the skull attained the beauty of the bright crest ornament, while the elephant&amp;rsquo;s hide itself was transformed into a silk garment with marks ( of swans &amp;amp;c.) on its borders made with rochana (yellow pigment formed from cow&amp;rsquo;s bile ).&#xA;(33.) The eye itself which shone in the middle of the frontal bone, and which had the clear tawny pupil in its interior, proved on the side of the presence of ( or after Malli.-became for the accomplishment of-i. e. served as) the tilaka mark of Haritala (yellow orpiment).&#xA;(34.) The bodies only of the lords of serpents transforming themselves into different ornaments in their proper places underwent a change: the brilliant gems in their hoods remained just as they were.&#xA;(35.) What was the use of putting on the crest-jewel to Hara, whose crest is always united with the moon, which sheds even during the day the brilliance of its rays and which does not manifest the spot on account of its being merely a digit.&#xA;(36.) He, the only (chief) source of wonderful things who had (thus ) created all the well-known articles of dress by his divine power, saw his image reflected in a sword brought by a gana ( servant) who was near.&#xA;(37.) He, reclining on Nandi&amp;rsquo;s arm, mounted the lordly bull looking at the mountain Kailasa, whose broad back was covered with a tiger&amp;rsquo;s skin, and who out of devotion to him had contracted his huge bulk, and set out.&#xA;(38.) The mothers following the God and having their ear-rings agitated by the motion of their vehicles, made the sky a bed of day-lotuses, as it were, with their faces yellowish-white (or reddish white-Malll. ) with the pollen (in the shape) of their encircling effulgence.&#xA;(39.) Behind them, having the brilliance of gold shone the goddess Kalf, wearing ornaments of white skulls like an array of blue clouds with cranes (assembled) and throwing flashes of lightning far in the front.&#xA;(54)&#xA;(40.) Then the auspicious sound of music sent forth by the ganas marching in front of S&amp;rsquo;iva (the trident-holder) pervading the domes of their celestial vehieles, told the gods that it was right time for them to wait upon ( the god).&#xA;(41.)&#xA;The sun held the new umbrella made by Tvashtr (the heavenly architect); and the god, with his head at no great distance from its silk fringe, appeared to have the Ganges, as it were, falling on his head.&#xA;(42.) Ganga and Yamuna also, assuming visible forms and holding Chaurics, served the god, at that time appearing to have as it were a flight of swans, although their riverforms were changed.&#xA;(43.) The primeval Creator and the god bearing the mark Srivatsa (Vishnu) came incarnate to him, magnifying his glory with the words Be victorious,&amp;rsquo; like fire with clarified butter.&#xA;(44.) That was but one form divided in the three waystheir seniority or juniority is common (interchangeable ): sometime Hara is prior to Vishnu or Hari to the former; sometimes the Creator to them both; at others the two to the Creator.&#xA;(45.) The protectors of worlds, with Indra, chief among them, appearing in modest (humble) dresses, the signs of royalty being cast off, and betokening Nandi to allow them an interview, bowed with joined palms when ushered in.&#xA;(46.)&#xA;He honoured Brahman with a nod of the head, Hari with words spoken, Indra with a smile, and the other gods with a mere look, according to seniority.&#xA;(47.)&#xA;The seven&#xA;sages first pronounced a benediction saying, May you prosper,&amp;rsquo; and he said to them with a smile-In this nuptial sacrifice that is commenced, you have already been chosen by me as the officiating priests.&#xA;(48.) S&amp;rsquo;iva (lit. the wearer of a portion of the lord of stars) who is not to be overpowered by dark passions and whose glory regarding his destruction of the three cities was sung by celestial lute-bearers, (or, skilled choristers) with Vis wavasu as their leader, crossed the way.&#xA;(55)&#xA;(49.) The bull, moving charmingly through the sky with his golden little bells resounding and repeatedly shaking his horns, which piercing through the ck uds appeared as if covered with mud by being struck against a bank (or skirt of a mountain) bore him on.&#xA;(50.) He (the bull) arrived in a moment at the city protected by the lord of mountains, which had never experienced an attack from an enemy, drawn as if by the glances of Hara extending forward like golden strings.&#xA;(51.) The god, with his neck dark like a clond (or whose neck was of a deep dark) alighting in its vicinity from the path marked by his own arrow (the sky), being looked at by the townsmen with faces raised up through curiosity, went to the surface of an adjacent ground.&#xA;(52.) The lord of mountains, delighted at his arrival, went forth to receive him, with arrays of elephants mounied by his rich kinsfolk as with his own ridges full of trees smiling with full-blown flowers.&#xA;(53.) The two parties of the gods and the mountains with their bustle reaching far, met at the gate of the city with its doors thrown open, like two streams of water breaking through the same bridge with their commotion spreading to a distance.&#xA;(54.)&#xA;The mountain felt ashamed being saluted by Hara, adorable to the three worlds. For he did not know that his own head was already far bent low by his (the god&amp;rsquo;s) glory.&#xA;(55.) He with his beautiful face brightening through joy, led the way (lit. getting to the state of a leader ) of his son-in-law and conducted him to his wealthy city, in the market-streets of which flowers were scattered knee-deep.&#xA;(56.) At that time, the beauteous ladies of the city, eager to obtain a good sight of I&amp;rsquo;sa, spontaneously acted in the following way, all other occupations being set aside, in the rows of palaces.&#xA;(57.) A certain lady going in haste to the window did not at all think of tying up her mass of hair, which was&#xA;( 56 )&#xA;loosened from its tie with its wreath of flowers dropped down, though holding it in the hand.&#xA;(58.) Some lady snatching her fore-foot held by her dressing maid, while the red dye on it was yet wet, and having given up her graceful galt stretched a line of footprints marked with red-lace to the latticed window.&#xA;(59.) Another lady having adorned her right eye with collyrlum, while her left eye was without it, went in that very state, to the vicinity of) the window, holding (in her hand) the painting pencil or stick.&#xA;(60.) Another of the fair sex who was looking (lit. directed her eye) through the lattices of the window did not fasten the knot of her under garment loosened by her hasty movement, but stood holding up her garment with her hand with the brilliance of its ornaments penetrating ber&#xA;navel.&#xA;(61.) The waist-band, half-strung, of another lady who rose in haste, the gems of which dropped at every illplaced step, had only its string left at the time, fastened to the root of her big toe.&#xA;(62.) The windows, having their holes filled up with the faces of those ladies, stirred up with intense curiosity, with the scent of wine remaining within and the rolling eyes like black bees hovering about, looked as if they were decorated with lotuses.&#xA;(63.) In the meantime Hara (lit. the moon, crested God) came to the royal road with numerous flags flying and adorned with ornamental arches raised, doubling, even in the day time, the splendour of the tops of palaces by shedding on them moonlight.&#xA;(64.)&#xA;The women, ardently looking at him, the one -object of sight, with their eyes, did not think of any other object of sense thus the functions of all their other senses had entered as it were their eyes in their entirety.&#xA;(65.) Rightly did Aparnâ, though of delicate frame, practise penance, hard to perform, for him. Blessed will be the woman (lit. she will have the mission of life fulfilled)&#xA;(57)&#xA;who obtains the privilege of even serving him; what to say then of her who can repose on his lap.&#xA;(66.)&#xA;Had not the Creator united with each other this pair, of covetable beauty, then the effort of the lord of creation to endow the two with beauty would have been fruitless.&#xA;(67.) Surely the body of Kàma (the flower-arrowed god) was not burnt by him, his anger being roused on seeing the god; it was from shame, I think, that Kama relinquished his boby of his own accord.&#xA;(68.) Having through good-luck, entered into relationship, ardently desired by the mind, with this lord, O friend, the lord of mountains will hold higher his head already lofty by his sustaining the earth.&#xA;(69.) The three-eyed god, thus hearing the talks gratifying to the ear, of thy gay ladies of Oshadhiprastha, came to the abode of IIimálaya, where the handfuls of fried rice were pulverised by armlets.&#xA;(70.)&#xA;Then descending, assisted by Achyuta by offering his arm, from his bull, like the sun from an autumnal cloud, he entered the apartments of the lord of mountains previously entered into by Brahma.&#xA;(71.) Just after him there arrived at the house of the mountain the gods headed by Indra, the great sages preceded by the seven sages, and the attendants of S&amp;rsquo;iva, as great achievements follow an excellent beginning ( measure ).&#xA;(72.) There the lord. seated on a seat, duly accepted the offering of worship with jewels, honey, curds and clarified butter, and a pair of new silk garments-all of them presented by the mountain, with the recitation of the holy mantras.&#xA;(73.) He, clad in silk garments, was conducted to the bride by the well-behaved keepers of the inner apartment, as the (water of the) sea is carried on to the shore by the rays of the rising moon (lit. the new rays of the moon ).&#xA;Being united with her the beauty of whose moonlike face was heightened, like the world with the autumnal season, the beauty of whose face, the moon, is increased,&#xA;(74.)&#xA;( 58 )&#xA;S&amp;rsquo;iva had the lotuses of his eyes expanded like water rendered clear (delighted).&#xA;(75.) The eyes of the two, eagerly longing to see each other, which shrank back as they met and which were withdrawn after being steadied a little, experienced at that moment the restraint of bashfulness.&#xA;(76.) S&amp;rsquo;iva (lit. the god of eight forms) received her band the fingers of which were red, offered by her father, the mountain (or by the mountain&amp;rsquo;s priest ), as if it were the first sprout of the god of love, whose form was concealed in the body of Umâ through the fear of the god.&#xA;(77.) The hair on Umå&amp;rsquo;s body stood on end, while S&amp;rsquo;iva (lit. the bull-marked god) had his fingers perspired: by the joining of their hands the action of the mind-born (Cupid ) was equally divided between the two.&#xA;(78.) Since an ordinary bride and bridegroom on being married, attain excellent splendour (beauty from the presence of these two how can the beauty of the two be described when themselves brought in contact with each other?&#xA;(79.) By going round the blazing fire, keeping it to the right that couple, now united, shone like the day and night closely joined to each other and revolving round the sides of Meru.&#xA;(8.) The priest having conducted the bride and the bridegroom round the fire, with their eyes closed owing to mutual contact, made the bride offer fried rice into the kindled flre.&#xA;(81.) She, following the instructions of the priest, bent her face towards the smoke of agreeable smell, arising from the (burning) bandful of fried rice; the smoke, touching her cheek with its forepart, attained for a moment the state of the ear-lotus.&#xA;(82.) By receiving the smoke as required by the religious custom, the face of the bride bad the orbs of its cheeks a little moistened and ruddy, with the tint of the(59)&#xA;black collyrium flushed and the barley sprout worn as carornament withered away.&#xA;(83.) The Brahmana (priest) said to the bride, &amp;ldquo;Dear child, this fire is the witness to the conclusion of your marriage-rite: practise righteousness&#xA;practise righteousness with Siva, your husband, giving up argumentation (c. with implicit acquiescence).&#xA;(84.) Those words of the preceptor were drunk ( listened to attentively) by Bhavani, with ears stretched up to the borders of the eyes, like the first water of the rains (lit. come from Mahendra) by the earth extremely parched by the sultry season.&#xA;(85.) Directed by her eternal lord, charming to look at, to see the polar star, she raising her face, with her throat choked with bashfulness, said with difficulty &amp;lsquo;scen.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;(86.) With their marriage-ceremony thus performed by the family priest versed in the ceremonial, the two parents of creation, bowed to the Creator, seated on a lotus.&#xA;(87.) The bride was greeted by the Creator with the words &amp;ldquo;Blessed one, be you the mother of a hero.&amp;rdquo; Though the master of speech, he became slow to think (was at a loss to know) as to what blessing to pronounce in the case of S&amp;rsquo;iva.&#xA;(88.) Thereafter, the two, the bride and the bride-groom, coming to the four-cornered altar (dais) furnished with decorations and sitting on gold seats, experienced the application of wet whole-rice to the forehead, customary with the world and to be coveted.&#xA;(89.) The goddess of wealth held over them the lotus umbrella which possessed the beauty of a network of pearls by means of the drops of water attached to its petals, and the long stalk of which served as its pole.&#xA;(90.) The goddess of speech praised the couple with speech of a two-fold composition: the laudable bridegroom in a speech refined by grammatical purity, the bride in language easily comprehensible.&#xA;( 60 )&#xA;(91.) They saw, for a while, the first representation (of a play) in the combination of the different incidents of which the styles of description were properly brought out, in which the different sentiments were delineated by proper modes of music and in which there were graceful bodily movements (or gesticulations).&#xA;(92.) At its termination the gods with joined palms placed across their diadems prostrated themselves before Hara, who had married a wife and begged that the service of Káma, who had g. t back his body at the expiration of the curse pronounced on him, should now be accepted.&#xA;(93.) The Lord whose anger was gone permitted the operation of his arrows even on him. Surely a request, proferred to their master at the right time by those who know their business, bears success.&#xA;(94.) Now having dismissed the hosts of gods, the moon-crested god, taking the mountain&amp;rsquo;s daughter by the hand, went to the nuptial apartment in which pots of gold were placed, which was furnished with decorations ( of flowers, jewels &amp;amp;c. ) and in which a bed was spread on the ground.&#xA;(95.) There the Lord made Gaurí laugh secretly by the fantastic distortions of the faces of the Pramathas (his followers)-Gauri who looked graceful on account of bashfulness due to her being newly married, who turned away her face though drawn towards himself by him, and who replied with difficulty to her friends who used to sleep with her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
