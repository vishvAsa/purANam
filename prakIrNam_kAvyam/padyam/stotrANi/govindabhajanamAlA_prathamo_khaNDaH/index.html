<p><strong>GOVINDA BHAJANA MALA</strong></p>
<p><strong>———————</strong></p>
<p>PRAISE OF LORD GOVINDA BY<br>
LODD GOVINDAS</p>
<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>It is recognised by all religionists that the end and aim of human existence is to realise the divine Yogins, Vedantists, Philosophers and even Scientists have chalked out various paths leading to the realisation of divinity and sages endowed with powers of introspection have in the interest of spiritual evolution of humanity preached holy precepts with a view to create in man yearning for higher ideals One of such religious instructors― the famous Sankara viz, Sri Sankaracharya in one of his popular works &ldquo;Dvadasamanjarı” had made his observation describing most beautifully and in the pithiest manner certain phases of worldly experiences giving a clear idea of the transitory and ephemeral character of the world and its possessions and giving warning as to the futility of life and the disappointments to be faced therein Later on, some of Sri Sankaracharya&rsquo;s disciples such as Hasthamalaka, Suresvara Padmapada etc. continuing</p>
<p>the tenor of his work said to have composed some more stanzas found in the stotra entitled either— Chaturdasa manjari or Charpatapanjari The Chaturdasamanjari, is said to have been composed of by 14 disciples of Sri Sankaracharya, according to South Indian publication Out of these 14 stanzas, I have omitted one stanza composed by Yogananda, I have taken 13 stanzas composed by 13 disciples of Sri Sankaracharya, as noted on the Stanzas given in this Book</p>
<p>In regard to the matter relating to the Dwadasamanjarika Stotra, the following Stanza is found in the books published in Tamil and Canarese charecter:</p>
<p>द्वादशमंजरिकाभिरशेषः।<br>
कतितोवैय्याकरणरयैषः॥</p>
<p>उपदेशोभूद्विद्यानिपुणैः।<br>
श्रीमच्छंकरभगवच्चरणैः॥</p>
<p>But in the Bombay Publication we find the Sloka as given below—</p>
<p>द्वादशपञ्जरिकामय एषः शिष्याणां कथितोह्युपदेशः।<br>
येषांचित्ते नैवविवेकः तेपच्यंतेनरकमनेकम्॥</p>
<p>In the Bombay publication of Charpatapanjarika we find 17 stanzas There seems to be some con</p>
<p>fusion and though there is some doubt, as to the correctness of one thing with the other, I have taken a popular view and proceeded with this work of Govinda Bhajana Mala I have taken all these publications into consideration and settled the stanzas in the order in which I have given in this, my book, compiled and entitled &ldquo;Govinda Bhajana Mala&rdquo; I have taken stanzas from both the Panjaris and out of the 14 stanzas composed by 14 desciples of Sri Sankaracharya, I have taken those composed by 13 of the following desciples—</p>
<p>1 Padmapadhacharya 2 Nityanandha, 3 Throtakacharya, 4, Hasthamalaka, 5 Warthikakara, 6 Anandagiri, 7 Drudhabhakta, 8 Nithyanatha, 9 Surendra (alias) Mandanamisra 10 Bharathivamsa 11 Sumathi 12, Medhatithi13 Subodha</p>
<p>There seems to be some doubt in regard to Pathabheda I have also taken the liberty of making very slight alterations here and there in certain compositions for maintaining rythm without affecting the meanings thereof</p>
<p>It will be seen that I have taken the 12 stanzas by Sankara from Dwadasamanjarika and 13 by his disciples as stated above and the rest are those composed of by Sankara and his followers as will be found in Bombay publication Dwadasamanjarika and Chaipatapanjarika Stotras besides giving those composed of by my humbleself I find a considerable</p>
<p>difference between the publications of Bombay and those in South India with Tamil and Canarese translations 7 stanzas of those contained in Bombay publication are missing in South Indian publications and 7 stanzas that are published in South Indian Dwadasamanjari do not find place in Bombay publications.</p>
<p>Thus I have given 50 stanzas in this book in all, as mentioned above, embodying certain observations in the light of the present day experiences All these stanzas have been divided into five groups under the following heads :—</p>
<ol>
<li>Futility of life and the transient nature of the world 2.  The disappointinents in life 3.  Advice and warning 4.  Caution against misguidance and malpractices 5.  Hints for attaining spiritual knowledge and devotion to God</li>
</ol>
<p>The keynote of the whole work consists in emphasising the efficacy of the praise of God— Lord Govinda in leading the path of devotion and for the attainment of spiritual knowledge Sankara opines that one should not be engrossed in mere literary attainment&rdquo; and worldly lore but he should devote himself to Govinda in view of the transitory nature</p>
<p>of human existence with its limited duration involving varieties of troubles and disappointments which as well described in the following sloka :—</p>
<p>आयुर्नश्यति पश्यतां प्रतिदिनं याति क्षयं यौवनम्।<br>
प्रत्यायान्ति गताः पुनर्न दिवसाः कालो जगद्भक्षकः॥</p>
<p>लक्ष्मीस्तोयतरंगभंगचपला विद्युच्चलं जीवितम्।<br>
तस्मान्मां शरणागतं प्रतिदिनं त्वं रक्ष रक्षस्वमाम्॥</p>
<p>It is surprising to see that man expects everlasting existence in this world, though he actually sees a number of men being snatched away by death &rsquo;every day&rsquo;, and their bodies carried away to different burning and burial grounds</p>
<p>Dharmaraja considers this as the most wonderful thing in the world and the &ldquo;wonder of all wonders&rdquo; and says in reply to Yaksha as follows—</p>
<p>अहन्यहनि भूतानि प्रविशन्ति यमालयम्।<br>
शेषाः स्थावरमिच्छन्ति किमाश्चर्यमतः परम्॥</p>
<p>We are aware that the span of human life mostly extends to about hundred years Half of this is naturally spent in sleep Of the remaining 50 years, half the portion is used up in childhood and old age The remaining portion of the few years is subjected to diseases, sufferings, bereavements, servitude etc Life being thus akin to Waves</p>
<p>flickering on the water, where is the happiness for mortals? The above is the idea contained in the following sloka—</p>
<p>आयुर्वर्षशतंनृणां परिमितं रात्रौ तदर्धगतम्।<br>
तस्यार्थस्यपरन्यचार्धमपरं बालत्ववृद्धत्वयोः॥</p>
<p>शेषं व्याधिवियोगदुःखसहितं सेवादिभिर्नीयते।<br>
जीवे बास्तिरंचंचलतरे सौख्यं कुतः प्राणिनाम्॥</p>
<p>Of the various names of God, the name Govinda seems to have fascinated Sri Sankara and his disciples as one, most appropriate and efficacious to recite for the purpose of devotion to God in view of its great significance and importance Perhaps. His Holiness Sri Sankara has adopted the word Govinda on account of the importance attached to this name of God in Gopalatapani Upanishad in which it is found <strong>गोविन्द नाम्नामृत्युर्विभेति</strong> means Yama is afraid of the person uttering the name of Govinda</p>
<p>Though the names Govinda and Gopala appear to be synonymous, yet the former has a wider significance than the latter and is more comprehensive in its meaning Besides, the great name Govinda is one, that appeals to God most, as has been declared by Sree Krishna when Draupadi addressed Him in the name of Govinda according to the following popular sloka—</p>
<p>शंखचक्रगदापाणे द्वारकानिलयाच्युत।<br>
गोविन्दपुण्डरीकाक्ष रक्ष मां शरणागतम्॥</p>
<p>The above passage occurs with reference to Draupadi&rsquo;s Saranagathi when she loudly cried and called God by the name Govinda for help, when she was in trouble It is noteworthy to point out that the name Govinda pronounced in the above stanza touched the very heart of Sree Krishna to such an extent that he felt greatly indebted to her Sri Krishna admits that He will not be able to clear the heavy debt he owed to Draupadi for the utterance of the word Govinda as found in the following sloka—</p>
<p>गोविन्देति यदाक्रन्दत्कृष्णा मां दूरवासिनम्।<br>
ऋणंप्रवृद्धमिव मे हृदयान्नापसर्पति॥</p>
<p>The word Govinda according to its derivation conveys four chief ideas i.e,<br>
1 The protector of cows<br>
2 The promptor of the senses.<br>
3 The master of the highest knowledge of Vedas<br>
4 and one that has raised the globe of the earth from the abyss below in the form of Varaha in Varaha Avatara as observed in Mahabharata</p>
<p>गोविन्दता भगवता गोविन्देनामितौजसा।<br>
वराहरूपिणाचान्तर्विक्षोभितजलाविलम्॥</p>
<p>A few extracts given by me in Sanskrit in this book as to the derivation and greatness of the word Govinda, the popular name of God, will give sat sfaction to those who are desirous to know as to the importance of the word Govinda and its derivation.</p>
<p>Lord Govinda having protected a large number of cows by giving them shelter, by raising the mountain of Govardhana by the tip of his little finger is well known and he is worshipped as &lsquo;Govardhan&rsquo; Nathji in Mewar in Rajputana Indra while addressing Lord Govinda says in the following term—</p>
<p>अहं किलेन्द्रो देवानां त्वं गवामिन्द्रतांगतः।<br>
गोविन्द इति लोकारत्वां स्तोष्यन्ति भुवि शाश्वतम्॥</p>
<p>As protector of cows, Lord Govinda is not only the giver of life for babies and children and nourishment to invalids and vitality to mankind in general by supply of milk and vitamins but also the prime factor for the advancement of the economic condition of the world by the development of its agricultural resources</p>
<p>As promptor of the senses and giver of energy for action, Brihaspati says—</p>
<p>गोशब्देनोदिता जिह्वा तत्प्रवेशोहि तालुणि</p>
<p>Govinda is the Lord of Vedas and Upanishads and as such he is the giver of knowledge In Vishnu Thilaka, it is found—</p>
<p>गोभिरे पयतोवैद्यो गोविन्दस्समुदाहृतः।</p>
<p>which means, Lord Govinda can be known only through the knowledge of Vedas, for it is observed as follows—</p>
<p>गां वेदलक्षणां वाणीं गोभूम्यादिकं वा वेत्ति इति गोविन्दः।</p>
<p>Even Buddhists have recognised a deeper philosophical significance in the word Govinda as stated in the following:—</p>
<p>गावः मनः प्रधानानि इन्द्रियाणि।<br>
तेषां विन्दः प्रवर्तयिता अन्तर्याम्यात्मेति॥</p>
<p>I have already mentioned above what is stated in GopalatapaniUpanishad that Yama is afraid of the word Govinda and would not approach those that utter the word Govinda, the powerful name of God</p>
<p>The soul of man issaved from visiting Yamaloka by uttering the name Govinda and will have an easy walk over through Archiradımarga leading to Goloka or Vaikuntha by getting purified from sins if any, avoiding Dhoomadimarga and I here point out what Yama instructs his retinue regarding the word Govinda He, Yama has issued strict orders to his subordinates not to</p>
<p>approach or molest the devotees of Govinda as stated in the following quotation from the Vishnu Purana—</p>
<p>ये तिष्ठन्तस्वपन्तश्च गच्छन्तश्चलितेक्षुतेः।<br>
संकीर्त्ययान्ति गोविन्दं तेवरत्याज्यारसुदूरतः॥</p>
<p>For these and other reasons, the name of Govinda has acquired the great popularity according to theology Consequently, we find the name Govinda ringing in our ears here and there owing to its incessant repetition by devotees and pilgrims in all parts of the country by the same being used in Bhajanas Keerthanas etc</p>
<p>The word Govinda is used in Achamana or purifying observance by sipping water to signify his omnipresent and omnipotent nature Further, the word Govinda is repeated thrice before performing every Sankalpa, because, He, Govinda is the Lord of everything and is able to absolve one from sins and rectifies all defects in the course of all ceremonies</p>
<p>The great sage Athri says, the manner in which the word Govinda is to be repeated on account of its importance of godly value—</p>
<p>गोविन्देति सदा स्नानं गोविन्देति सदाजपः।<br>
गोविन्देति सदाध्यानं सदा गोविन्दकीर्तनम्॥</p>
<p>He has further observed in Panḍavagitha as follows—</p>
<p>अक्षरं हि परंब्रह्म गोविन्देत्यक्षरत्रयं।<br>
तस्मादुच्चरितं येन ब्रह्मभूयाय कल्पते॥</p>
<p>The sacred value of the word Govinda is further stated by Maharshi Gauthama as follows—</p>
<p>गोकोटिदानं ग्रहणेषु काशीप्रयागगंगायुतकल्पवासः।<br>
यज्ञायुतं मेरुसुवर्णदानं गोविन्दनाम्ना न कदापितुल्यम्॥</p>
<p>It means that giving away in charity a crore of cows at the time of eclipse in Benares or living for thousands of Kalpas on the banks of the Ganges, in Benares and Piayag or the performance of the ten thousand yagas on the gift of gold of the height of the great mountain Meru— all these cannot equal in value to the efficacy of the utterance of the name Govinda</p>
<p>The above qualifications are sufficient to illustrate the spiritual and godly value for uttering the name of Lord Govinda for the purification and elevation of the human soul I may also add that the greatness and the glory of Lord Govinda surpasses easy conception when we consider His creation and even one of the several Brahmandas created by him comprising different compositions of different elements with a number of sub-worlds and planets and stars attached thereto with their different movements and rotations suited to different tracts or areas in the huge form of Visva or cosmos or what is popularly known as Virat or Visvaroopa</p>
<p>It will be interesting to note that when Govinda in the form of Balakrishna was found eating his splendid sott butterlike mud on the bank of Yamuna near Gokula village he was taken to task by Yasoda and on being scolded by mother Yasoda, he opened his mouth and showed to his mother as to what contained in his mouth and body as observed in Srimath Bhagavatha in 10th book, chapter 8, slokas 39 and 40 The mother Yasoda did not see the mud, but she saw the following comprising of all kinds of astronomical planes and planets and the various worlds consisting of the several parts of Virat, in the mouth of Lord Govinda</p>
<p>सा तत्र ददृशे विश्वंजगस्थास्थारनुच खं दिशः।<br>
साद्रिद्वीपादिभूगोलं सवाय्वग्नींदुतारकं॥</p>
<p>ज्योतिश्चक्रं ज्वलत्तेजो विवराणि रसातलं।<br>
वैकारिकाणीद्रियाणि मनोमात्राः गुणास्त्रयः॥</p>
<p>Consistent with the above in Amarakosha Lord Govinda is described as the Lord of Heavens (Swarga) the Lord of Earth, the Lord of Directions, the Lord of speech or learning the Lord of eyes, the Lord of water, the Lord of cattle, the Lord of rays, the Lord of arrows (asterik) or astrams</p>
<p>स्वर्गेषुपशुवाग्वज्रदिङ्नेत्रघृणिभूजले।</p>
<p>The name Govinda is further said to have the</p>
<p>efficacy of curing disease as proclaimed by the greatest medical authority Dhanvantariand, so the medical men will be well advised to submissively appeal to Almighty Lord Govinda before administering medicines and seek His help for success so that they can be more correct in treating the cases and thereby obtain greater success</p>
<p>Further Suka says with reference to this crown–name of God Lord Govinda <strong>चिन्तामणिश्च गोविन्दो</strong> which means the head name of God</p>
<p>This word Govinda occurs in two places in the popular Vishnu Sahasranama contained in the Mahabharata as will be observed in the 20th and 58th stanzas of the said Vishnu Sahasra nama Sri Sankara and Sri Ramanuja have in their commentaries to the Vishnu Sahasranama made reference to the meanings of the word Govinda as being found in Harivamsa and Vishnu Thilaka Even in the Vishnu Sahasranama contained in Srimad Bhagavata and also known as SriKrishna Sahasranama or Purushottama Sahasranama the name Govinda is adopted for <strong>कवच</strong> as will be found in the sloka</p>
<p>अस्त्रं सर्वसमर्थश्चगोविन्दः कवचं मतम्॥</p>
<p>Thus even in the Vishnu Sahasranama of Srimad Bhagavata we find the importance of the word Govinda as also found in 180th stanza which is as follows:—</p>
<p>इंद्रधेनुस्तुतिप्राप्तगोविन्देन्द्राभिधानवान्।<br>
व्रतादिधर्मसंसक्तनंदक्लेशविनाशकः॥</p>
<p>I delighttu&rsquo;lvfurther add as to what Sri Sankaracharya has said in addition to his prayer to Lord Govinda in Dwadasamanjari by composing the poem called Govinda Stothrom in which he Sri Sankara so beautifully describes the importance of the name Govind in the following manner which speaks for itself regarding the spiritual, the philosophical, the puranic and the historical and the all pervading nature of the name Govinda</p>
<p>I सत्य ज्ञानमनन्तं नित्यमनाकाशं परमाकाशं।<br>
II मायाकल्पितनानाकारमनाकारं भुवनाकारं॥</p>
<p>III व्यादितवक्त्रालोकितलोकालोकचतुर्दशलोकालिम्।<br>
IV लोकेशं परमेशं प्रणमत गोविन्दं परमानन्दम्॥</p>
<p>Sri Sankara concludes every stanza of the stotra with the burden clause The Govind stothram composed by Sri Brahmananda Swami also is very elegant in Sanskrit expounding the value of the name Govinda The Swami repeats in his stotra in the manner as follows with his burden clause</p>
<p>गोविन्दं परमसुखकन्दं भजत रे।</p>
<p>I have also annexed to this Govinda Bhajana Mala both the Stotras of Sri Sankara and Sri Brahmananda Swami to enable the readers to make</p>
<p>use of those stotras as well, in addition to the Govinda Bhajana Mala compiled and published by me</p>
<p>I have great pleasure in placing before such of the readers as are acquainted with the Gujarathi language, the Gujarathi Govind Bhajana, given in this book which I trust will be interesting to them by inspiring additional devotion, by uttering the Same in their own mother tongue</p>
<p>Further I have also given some Telugu and Tamil stanzas corresponding to some of the stanzas of the Govinda Bhajana Mala which may be useful to some of my Telugu and Tamilian brothren</p>
<p>I should like to point out that Sri Sankaracharya was the disciple of Sri Govind Bhagavat padacharya A happy coincidence of Sri Sankaracharya&rsquo;s Guru also having been given the name of Govinda</p>
<p>In this connection, I may be permitted to casually mention that my forefathers particularly adored Lord Govinda and my great grandfather was named Govindas, meaning the servant of Govinda and subsequently my late lamented and much esteemed father Dewan Bahadur Lodd Krishnadas was pleased to give my humble-self also the same name Govindas As such, I as the servant of God Govinda feel it my duty to inculcate the value and importance of the name Lord</p>
<p>Govinda for the benefit of seekers after truth. The selection made from the valuable stotras by Sri Sankaracharya and his disciples are published in an order which I consider suitable and appropriate with some additions of my own as mentioned aboveIt only remains for me to add that I shall feel that my humble labour in this direction is repaid if it kindles the earnest readers the spark of devotion and enables them to realise their religious duty and strive towards attaining eternal bliss Especially by such of the educated men or Shastris or Purohits or Priests that are either indifferent or encourage lethargy in the matter of devotion to God owing to pride or their being well placed in circumstances for the time being or owing to their inner thinking power being developed in to agnostic views due to Westernly ideas</p>
<p>With these observations, I conclude these introductory remarks to my Govinda Bhajana Mala offering my humble salutations to Lord Govinda by the following sloka given in Puranas describing the appropriate term Govinda</p>
<p>फुल्लेन्दीवरमिन्दुकान्तवदनं बर्हावतंसं प्रियं।<br>
श्रीवत्साङ्कमुदारकौस्तुभधरं पीतांबरं सुन्दरं॥</p>
<p>गोपीनां नयनोत्पलार्चिततनुं गोगोप संघावृतं।<br>

<p><strong>NOTICE</strong><br>
<strong>—————</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the stanzas composed by Sri Sankaracharya and his followers and those composed by myself and given by me in this book, entitled &ldquo;Govinda Bhajana Mala&rdquo;, I have also taken some stanzas from YatiRaja Stotra composed by Ranganatharya, the follower of Sri Ramanujacharya I have made some modifications in some of these stanzas also and the burden song of <strong>Bhaja Govindam Bhaja Govindam Govindam Bhaja Mudhamate</strong> has been adopted throughout All stanzas put together, they are 72 in number and not 50 as stated in page IV, line 8 of the preface to this book In addition to those stanzas given by me from YatiRaja Stotra in the 72 main stanzas I have also given several other stanzas from the said <strong>Bhaja Yatı Rajam Bhavabheero</strong>in several suitable places in foot notes as they are interesting</p>
<p>As regards the observations made by me in this book, they are not intended to apply or reflect in any way to any class or profession in general but only to such of the individuals as are of the nature described in this book I state this, lest I may not be misunderstood by any section or class of people In fact I have done my best in good faith in the interest of people and for the good of the public.</p>

<p>STRIKING REMARKS</p>
<p>Lord Bacon says—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed and some to be chewed and digested, viz, some books are to be read only in parts, others to be read but not curiously and some have to be read wholly and with diligence and attention Some books also may be read by a Deputy and extracts made of them by others</p>
<p>But I say—</p>
<p>This <strong>Govinda Bhajana Mala</strong> should not only be tasted, chewed, swallowed, eaten and digested, but also assimilated in the man&rsquo;s spiritual system with full mental absorption— with extreme devotion to Lord Govinda, preparatory to the happy renunciation and the ultimate Liberation Moksha (Salvation) as the sweetest fruition thereof</p>

<p>from their own sons mutilating the estate by claiming a division of the same, having regard to the baneful aspect of the Hindu Law that gives enormous trouble in the management of properties to parents which eventually results in the destruction of properties and the reputation of the family often owing to the instigation of interested extraneous agencies including some exceptional selfish lawyers The joint family system of Hindu Law when applied to families consisting merely of the father and his son or sons is sufficiently troublesome, and when it isextended to brothers and other collateral families and their descendants the curse knows no bounds Of course we have the other aspect of Hindu Law set out in Dayabhaga which has to be appreciated as it serves to keep the estates in tact</p>
<p>and when you are to be turned out of your own house for being buried or burnt to be reduced into dust or ashes you will leave all your wealth in its place or places Why then bother yourself so much in vain for the sake of wealth whether it is in the interests of yourself, your son, your wife, your friend or others (10)</p>

Absolutely no fear</p>
<p>Samskaras are indispensable religious rites and the purificatory processes for the body, soul and mind Samskaras are in the nature of sacraments observed in any creed They are as much essential to a Dvija as are the numerous formalities and forms to one seeking admission in a Club or Society and Masonic Lodge</p>

Oh : Ignorant and foolish-minded man.</p>
<p>It is said that Yama the God of Death takes away only the life of man whereas the bad Doctor takes away both life and money.</p>
<p>Many Doctors do not realise that disease is latent in the bodies of all men including their own bodies as Disease is only the forerunner of the inevitable Decease Understand that God is the true Doctor without whose help diseases can not be cured and who is also the Physician for curing that foremost of all diseases viz, the bond that binds one to this world as mentioned in Vishnu Sahasranama <strong>वेद्यो वैद्यस्सदा योगी॥</strong></p>
<p>The nervousness and inability of several Doctors is observed when epidemics of virulent type break out with powerful bacteria causing innumerable loss of lives without yielding to any treatment Hence the help of Almighty is indispensable</p>
<p>Instead of being content merely with the limited know ledge of physiology and chemistry and the study of organism with its mechanism and metabolism without the spiritualism attached there to and the ideas coming under the crude cate gory of Law of Nature, the Doctors will do well to study the finer subject of the Subtle and Astral body as well And in addition to prescribing mixtures to patients they may advance the study of the mixtures of the elements (which vary from 5 to 27) and the proportionate compositions and the processes thereof It is further necessary to make a study of the mind with its five divisions known as Antahharana, Manas, Buddhi, Chitta, and Ahankara It is also desirable to observe the several divisions of the vital airs in the body known as Prana, Apana, Vyana, Udana and Samana and their respective locations such as in the chest, in the lower part, in the whole body, in the neck and in the navel and their functions of breathing, expelling, perspiring, speechi fying and digesting respectively, together with the five subdivi sions of the five airs defined as Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Deva datta and Dhananjaya discharging the functions of be lching</p>
<p>the opening of the eyes, producing appetite, causing yawning and assimilating food respectively, as also their connections. with the five organs of action or senses, viz., the senses of sight, hearing, smelling, taste and touch and also the Antahkarana which is said to be the sense of senses or heart of hearts. It is essential to investigate the Atma, Soul or Spirit represented by the Finest Air, Ether or Akasa instead of being engaged only with the dissection work of lifeless body which is after all a temporary tenement of True Man.</p>

<p>It is surprising that among certain classes of people the sub-sectarian fury has advanced to such an extent as to ignore the value of religious symbols and put Namam (Tilak) on the buttocks of an elephant instead of on the forehead as reported in a case It is not proper that the worshippers of One God, the sons of one Father, and the brothers of the same Faith should indulge in quarrels It is unfortunate that many of these persons are found fighting for shadows in Civil and Criminal Courts in the name of Religion May good sense prevail with these Krodhacharis of the south, Lobhacharyas of Karnatak, Mohanandas of Upper India and Kamasastrulus of the Andhra and the Saddharma Viruddhacharyas of Western India</p>

<p>The one God who is all pervading is called Vishnu as the word is derived from <strong>विष्</strong> to pervade Hence all devotees of God to whatever religion or sect they may belong may be called Vaishnavas</p>
<p>यस्माद्विश्वमिद सर्व तस्य शक्त्या महात्मन।<br>
तस्मादेवोच्यते विष्णुर्विशधातो प्रवेशनात्॥</p>
<p>The etymological meaning of the word Vishnu is as onder—</p>
<p>विश्वव्यापनशीलत्वात् विष्णुरित्यभिधीयते॥</p>
<p>It is a pity that while the truth is <strong>एको विष्णुर्महद्भूतं</strong> some persons make a distinction in God Vishnu as Vedic Vishnu and Puranic Vishnu Note that all the names of Vishnu ought to denote one and the same Supreme Being as stated in Svetasvatara Upanishad in the following verse:—</p>
<p>एको देव सर्वभूतेषु गूढ सर्वव्यापी सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा।<br>
कर्माध्यक्ष सर्वभूताधिवास साक्षी चेता केवलो निर्गुणश्च॥</p>
<p>When the distinction between Siva and Vishnu itself is condemned and it is held by Shāstras that Siva and Vishnu are both one and the same Being, accoiding to the text <strong>शिवाय विष्णुरूपाय शिवरूपाय विष्णवे</strong>, it is surprising that people should make any distinction between Vishnu and Vishnu The idea that Vishnu and Siva are the same is confirmed in the very Vishnu Sahasranama as follows—</p>
<p>सर्वः शर्वः शिवः स्थाणुर्भूतादिनिधिरव्यय।</p>
<p>and it is further said in the same Vishnu Sahasranama—</p>
<p><strong>स्वयभू शभुरादित्य पुष्कराक्षो महास्वन॥</strong></p>
<p>Even in Siva Sahasranama which also occurs in the same Anusāsanıka Parva of Maha Bharata, Siva is addressed by the several names used for Vishnu, and he is also called Krishna(See 130th name in Siva Sahasranama)</p>
<p>अदन्तेदन्तरचना फलभेदाय नार्हति।<br>
हर एव हरि साक्षात् हरिरेवहर स्वयम्॥</p>
<p>Note that both Hara and Hari give the same results, the only difference licing that the former ends with <strong>अ</strong> while the latter ends with <strong>इ</strong> Also note the interesting sloka given below—</p>
<p>वासुदेव इति वामदेव इत्यस्तिकल्पतरुयुग्ममद्भुतम्।<br>
आददाति सुमभेदमावहत्ये.. मेवफलमिष्टमथिनाम्॥</p>
<p>Vasudeva and Vamadeva are two marvellous Kalpaka trees which put forth different kinds of flowers but bear one and the same kind of fruit to votaries according to their desires The only difference between the words <strong>वासुदेव</strong> and <strong>वामदेव</strong> is in the letters <strong>सु</strong> and <strong>म</strong>which form the word <strong>सुम</strong>meaning Flower The idea prevailing among some of the Sri Vaishnavas that the Vishnu comprised in the Hindu Trinity is separate from the Lord of Vaikuntha, seems to be an unnecessary factor in the matter of devotion, in view of the fact that Vishnu is so called because of His All-pervading</p>
<p>Nature on one side, and the protective character on the other It must be remembered that the Trinity Vishnu need not be treated as a separate Vishnu, because He has the same function of protection reserved to Himself which is the main function of that Lord of Vaikuntha If the power of protection had been delegated to Siva and the work of destruction to Vishnu then there could have been the justification of treating the Trinity Vishnu as a separate Vishnu</p>
<p>It will be also interesting to note the joint description of Siva and Vishnu given by the great Appayya Dikshita, in the following sloka recited by him before God Sri Govindaraja and God Nataraja at Chidambaram</p>
<p>मारमणम् उमारमण फणधरतल्प फणाधराकल्प।<br>

<p>The order of the day seems to be to eat and drink again and again and to keep on filling up the belly and attending frequent dinner parties in spite of indigestion, to be constantly engrossed in the enjoyment of women in spite of ill-health or old age and to be engaged in maintaining them though with insufficient income, to roam about from place to place hunting after pleasures in spite of pennilessness, to knock off the money of others by various schemes and means, and to be always doing some harm or other to others in spite of education and University Degrees It 1S a wonder that no thought is ever bestowed on the feet of the Almighty God!(40)</p>

<p>1 <strong>रमणीरमणम्</strong> In verse 26 of this book Sri Sankaracharya refers to monks as putting on deceitful appearances with kavi clothes for the sake of belly, but now-a-days we find also a number of henpecked men putting on several appearances with cloaks and collars and neckties, not only for the sake of mere belly but also for several unnecessary luxuries and gratification of lust, waiting to carry out the commandments of their better halves like an Aide-de-camp in waiting</p>
<p>In Mahanirvanatantia it is said—</p>
<p>कलिजा मानवा लुब्धाशिश्नोदरपरायणा॥</p>
<p>And this idea is also found in Vishnu Purana—</p>
<p>नानुतिष्ठन्ति मैत्रेय शिश्नोदरपरायणा॥</p>
<p>Finding that many persons are merged in the infatuation of women, a piece of warning is given in the work— Bhaja Yatı Rajam, Sloka 8, as under—</p>
<p>कलुषनिकाय ललनाकाय पश्यन् मुह्यसि साथ सायम्।<br>
जहि जहि हेय तद्व्यवसाय भज निरपाय चरमोपायम्॥</p>
<p>It is said that one has always to attend to the important duty of devotion to God and not to be carried away by the attractions of women The idea is that one should not become a prey to the</p>
<p>infatuation due to women Instead of punctually and readily attending to your darling damsels every evening that wait at the doors of your office at 5-30 P.M sharp, with the motor car or carriage to take you out for drives, cinemas, dramas or games, it is highly desirable to punctually perform at least your evening prayer and thereafter attend to your pleasures or engagements instead of following the funny Gujarati proverb which says &ldquo;Everything is merged in one&rsquo;s own self and his wite&rdquo;</p>
<p>हू अने मारीवहु, अने एमा आव्युसहु।</p>
<p>The author of Bhajayatırajam further points out the value of not losing your precious time which is misspent by sleep and sexual pleasures in the night and slandering others in the day It savs that the fool does not notice the passing away of time and little realises that he is nearing end without being able to attend to the holy work of devotion to God, as per the following verse—</p>
<p>निशि वनितासुवनिद्रालोल प्रात परदूषणपटुशील।<br>
अन्तर्याति निजायु काल कि जानाति नर पशुशील॥</p>
<p>The advice is given not to be led towards lustful life and the low-levelled lulling love attached thereto Do not therefore flirt which only gets you</p>
<p>dirt and ultimately you are hurt by the attraction of skirt</p>
<p>It is a wonder that wherever you go throughout the world, people hail the beauty of woman and it is surprising that poets are found to be extolling themin spite of the abnoxious descriptions mentioned heicunder</p>

<p>It is surprising to find the inconsistent thought prevailing among a section of educated men for encouraging the Western alcoholic drinks in the name of the broad-minded cosmopolitan views while discouraging Indian alcoholic drinks by advising the labourers not to indulge in them in the</p>
<p>name of the moral and scientific uplift of the country, not to speak of taking to eat the nonrequired animal food in the hope of bringing about in admixture of nationalities even by extending matrimonial relationship with or without samskaras with foreign nations Indeed— A Really REVOLUTIONARY JUMP</p>

<p>पीत्वा पीत्वा पुन पीत्वा यावत्पतति भूतले।<br>

<p>The above stanza is a specimenof their degenerate mentality</p>
<p>3 <strong>परधनहरण</strong> Money-making tacticsMoneymaking methods of the present day have become so numerous that they have grown into a science and it is practically developing into money knocking</p>
<p>philosophy The noble idea of <strong>परद्रव्येषु लोष्टवत्</strong> has been displaced by the modern ideal <strong>परद्रव्येषु लड्डुवत्</strong> and the idea of <strong>धर्मे सर्व प्रतिष्ठितम्</strong> has been substituted by <strong>अर्थे सर्व प्रतिष्ठितम्।</strong></p>
<p>In Maha Bharata it is said thus—</p>
<p>अर्थस्य पुरुषो दासो दासत्वर्थो न कस्यचित्।</p>
<p>Bhartrihari also says in this connection.</p>
<p>जातिर्यातु रसातल गुणगणस्तत्राप्यथां गच्छतात्<br>
शील शैलतलात् पतत्वभिजन सन्दह्यता वह्निना।<br>
शौर्ये वैरिणि वज्रमाशु निपतत्वथोऽस्तु न केवल<br>
येनैकेन विना गुणास्तृणलवप्रायास्समस्ताइमे॥</p>
<p>Money, money, money isthe only motto &lsquo;sacrifice everything else&rsquo;</p>
<p>When we come across unscrupulous persons who dictate to you their own terms of unreasonable demands on pain of giving you trouble of a temporary or permanent nature, inconvenience or loss, how you are moved to helplessly submit to such demands!It is a matter of great regret especially in the circumstances when one is unable to agitate or represent grievances owing to adverse conditions</p>
<p>It is said in some Sanskrit works—</p>
<p>अर्थार्थी जीवलोकोऽयं श्मशानमपि सेवते।</p>
<p>Viz love for money leads low-minded men to long for lucrative jobs even in cemetaries, but these low deals should not be encouraged howevei much one may be merged in the desire of acquiring wealth &ldquo;Honesty is the best policy&rdquo; is certainly a worthy rule to be followed though sometimes dishonesty pays to unscrupulous persons God has given an apt description of such avaracious persons in the Gita (Chap 16 Sloka 12) as follows—</p>
<p>आशापाशशतैर्बद्धा कामक्रोधपरायणा।<br>
इहत कामभोगार्थअन्यायेनार्थसञ्चयान्॥</p>
<p>The tendency of the modern times seems to be to cheat one another and to cultivate a Kleptomaniac mentality which ought to be discouraged in the interests of society and individual character On the other hand it is desirable&rsquo; to encourage the ideals of honesty, equity and generosity particularly amongst those socalled educated men that require to be truly educated</p>
<p>It is better to suffer from some valvulai disease of the heart than to entertain any fraudulent thought in the valves of the heart which is the sanctum sanctorum and the seat of God See what is stated in Uttara Narayaniya</p>
<p>हृदय तद्विजानीयात् विश्वस्यायतन महत्॥</p>
<p>But lo, we find to our great surprise the undesirable attitudes entertained even by highly educated men as described below—</p>
<p>नीचससर्गनिरता परवित्तापहारका।<br>
परनिन्द्रापरद्रोहपरिवादपरा खला॥</p>
<p>Be aloof from the wicked who take pleasuie in associating with ill-bred people, who high handedly haunt after you and unsympathetically extort moneyon some pietext or other, and who indulge in blackmailing and backbiting, treachery and trickery and slander without candour</p>
<p>अकरुणत्वमकारणविग्रह परधने परयोषिति च स्पृहा।<br>

<p>न मां दुष्कृतिनो मूढा प्रपद्यन्ते नराधमाः।<br>
माययाऽपहृतज्ञाना आसुरं भावमाश्रिताः॥</p>
<p>(Gita Chap 7, Sloka 15)</p>
<p>Men of evil deeds, the ignorant and ignoble men will not attain Me, as they are divorced ofunderstanding by Maya, and as they are men of demoniac nature.</p>
<p>The iniquity of selfishness has been described by Bhartriharı as follows—</p>
<p>एते सत्पुरुषाः परार्थघटकाः स्वार्थान्परित्यज्यये<br>
सामान्यास्तु परार्थमुद्यमभृतः स्वार्थाविरोधेन ये।<br>
तेऽमी मानुषराक्षसाः परधन स्वार्थाय निघ्नन्ति ये,<br>

<p>The horrible feature of <strong>दुष्कृति</strong> is to be regretted when we find the capacity of developing the incapacity of doing good to others among some of the educated men contrary to all advice received by them at the hands of a number of Chancellors or Vice-Chancellors May God forbid the association of these educated cut-throats and ill-wishers, and of those who have saturated their brains in extreme avarice, greed, and jealousy with the ideal of all in all selfishness working in the cells thereof</p>

<p>Become yourself your own Guru and first study yourself, your own body, your own acts, your own self, your own Maker, your own Death and try to realise your own probable state &ldquo;after Death&rdquo; These enquiries will be sufficient to rouse your</p>
<p>mind to secure Supreme Knowledge and then gradually you become your own Guru</p>
<p>Note that the analysis of your own actions good and bad, the idea of calculating your own virtues and sins, the cause of your own birth, existence and sufferings and death-these ideas will help you to a great extent in advancing devotion and philosophy Add to your pocket diary the thought of death as a daily remembrancer which will greatly help you to think of your Maker, and lead to salvation It is no use depending upon those who are professional Gurus of various types, whether Brahmin or Non-Brahmin, married crunmarried, educated or uneducated, young or old, man or woman and those who have formed into communities and taken to live on Guruism from generations and who are fondly proud of being called Gurus</p>
<p>In Guru-gita chapter 3, sloka 78, the following is found—</p>
<p>गुरवो बहवस्सन्ति शिष्यवित्तापहारका।<br>
दुर्लभोऽयं गुरुर्देवि शिष्यहृत्तापहारक॥</p>
<p>Some of these Gurus are inclined to advice you not to acquire knowledge, not to study philosophy, not to observe Karmas, not to practice Yoga, but only to devote yourself to them with blind faith</p>
<p>and entirely depend upon them only in the name of Achalabhakti and satisfy their desires as if they have taken a permanent lease of Vaikuntha or that of Mukti</p>
<p>The following sloka disclaiming liberation, disclaiming Shastraic religious devotion and dislaiming knowledge will be sufficient to point out as to how sectarian views are preferred to the ideal of seeking after Truth and rational ideas after undergoing so many austerities It may be the attempt to avoid the practice of all austerities and even to defraud God by disregarding the saying— <strong>परलोकममायया</strong> and the desire to be merged in Samsara along with devotion, but how can this be easily possible while Samsara is a poisonous tree</p>
<p>Look at the following Slokadiscarding even Mukti oi salvation</p>
<p>न मे वाञ्छयो मोक्ष श्रुतिषु चतुरात्मानिगदितो<br>
न शास्त्रीया भक्तिर्न पुनरिह विज्ञानमपि मे।<br>
कदाचिन्मा स्वामिन्यहह मयि दासे कृपयतु<br>
स्वत स्वाचार्याणा चरणशरणे दीनकरुणा॥</p>
<p>(Haridasa, a follower of the Vallabha School)</p>
<p>Most of the professional Gurus are merged in worldly and family affairs and Samsaric turmoils</p>
<p>and yet desire to be treated on a par with God simply because of the following sloka:—</p>
<p>यस्य देवे पराभक्तिः यथा देवे तथा गुरौ॥</p>
<p>But what can these Gurus do, while they themselves are drowned in the Ocean of Samsara? Visvagunadarsam says:—</p>
<p>स्वयं तरितुमक्षमः किमपरानसी तारयेत्॥</p>
<p>Unfortunately the desire for being admired has taken a strong hold on them just in the same manner as other persons belonging to several professions are subjected to. Even regarding the school of Advaita, I learn that it is stated:—</p>
<p>अद्वैतं त्रिषु लोकेषु नाद्वतं गुरुसन्निधौ।</p>
<p>As regards taking to Sanyasam or renunciation it is proclaimed as per following:—</p>
<p>तत्वज्ञाने समुत्पन्ने वैराग्यं जायते यदा।<br>
तदा सर्वंपरित्यज्य सन्यासाश्रममाचरेत्॥</p>
<p>Mahanirvanatantra.</p>
<p>Viz. a person should take to the life of Sanyasin or renunciation only when his Vairagya is fully matured by giving up all concerns. Look at how Vairagya ought to be cultivated as described by Sri Sankaracharya:—</p>
<p>ब्रह्मादिस्थावरान्तेषु वैराग्य विषयेष्वनु।<br>
यथैव काकविष्ठाया वैराग्य तद्वि निर्मलम्।</p>
<p>It is only when you disregard every thing in the whole of the universe like the dung of a crow you can be considered to have gained real Vairagya.Where is the necessity for collecting money like taxes for enjoying paraphernalia— that too for Sanyasins against all principles of simplicity?</p>
<p>But we find a number of persons taking to the lite of Sanyasins, Bairagis, Sadhus, Pandarams etc, with the internal object of gaining wealth on one side and enjoying royal paraphernalia on the other and leading a princely life with a number of worldly requirements and pleasures instead of discarding them Many are found to be keenly watching to jump at the office of Mathadhipatis for securing varıous desires with an inwardly attachment towards the worldly matters with an outwardly detachment Some of them keep on gradually increasing their personal wealth and indirectly enriching their family members, being mostly engrossed in the management of properties with a number of schemes and engaged in litigation, correspondence, accounts, law courts, and what not Different kinds of problems concerning private, personal, Matam and Devasthanam properties keep them engaged, more than family men. The Sanyasın&rsquo;s Samsaia is found</p>
<p>to be more extensive than the Samsara of family men.</p>
<p>It is surprising to observe that while the idea of riding or driving on animals is generally condemned by charitable persons that advocate kindness towards animals we find among Sanyasins and Bairagis, the practice of riding on men or driving on vehicles carried by men even in this age of civilisation The author of Bhaja Yathi Rajam condemns this attitude of such Sanyasins as will be found in the following stanza perhaps in the light of his own observation</p>
<p>नरवाहनगजतुरगारूढा नारीसुतपोषणगुणगूढा।<br>
नानारञ्जकविद्याप्रौढा नागरिका कि यतयो मूढा॥</p>
<p>The curiosity of renunciation is observed when we find some of the monks or Sanyasins going about to receive alms or Bhiksha by driving in Palanquins One does not understand why this royal life to be combined with begging! Then again we find them carrying on Pooja from place to place and not even observing Chatur masyam and making Pooja to girls and giving sarees to women during Navaratri festivals, etc, occasions, why this Kamya Vratha for Sanyasins ?</p>
<p>What a pity that even Sanyasins are meiged in Moh and even become Dandies as described</p>
<p>above while calling themselves Tridandies <strong>(त्रिदण्डि)</strong> and Dandies <strong>(दण्डिः)</strong></p>
<p>In describing the luxurious life of Sanysins Visvagunadarsam congratulates them in the following terms :—</p>
<p>भिक्षां कष्टमटन्ति कुक्षिभृतये पादौ गतैः क्लेशय-<br>
न्त्यच्छन्नाः शिथिलैः पटैश्च गृहिणोजीर्णे गृहे शेरते।<br>
राजत्सूक्ष्मपटाः प्रास्तशिविकारूढागृहिभ्योऽन्नदा<br>
ग्रावव्यूहदृढे मठे स्थितिजुषो धन्या हि संन्यासिनः॥</p>
<p>Are these seekers of wealth, fortune and worldly comforts to be considered as real Sanyasins or as some of the Sanyasins themselves admit, they are to be called Raja–Sanyasins or more appropriately Rajasa-Sanyasins?</p>
<p>It is to avoid the false assumption of greatness by selfish men that Sri Sankara said that the headship of Mutt should not be possessed even in a number of cycles of births as pointed out in the following sloka:—</p>
<p>पौरोहित्यं रजनिचरितं ग्रामणित्वं नियोगो<br>
माठापत्यं ह्यनृतवचनं साक्षिवादः परान्नम्।<br>
ब्रह्मद्वेषः खलजनरतिः प्राणिनां निर्दयत्वम्<br>
माभूदेवं मम पशुपते जन्मजन्मान्तरेऽपि॥</p>
<p>Finding that it is difficult to observe all the austerities and it is impossible to lead the life of propel Sanyaşam in the Kali Yuga, Shastras have condemned the taking of Sanyasam as stated below in Parasara Smriti—</p>
<p>अश्वालम्भ गवालम्भ सन्यास पलपैतृकम्।<br>
देवरण सुतोत्पत्ति कलौ पञ्च विवर्जयेत्॥</p>
<p>But this condemnation of SanyasiAshrama I got over by several explanations just in the same manne as justifications are offered by several lawyers regarding then actions</p>
<p>As a result of the advance of Kali it is regrettable to find that among those married and unmarried Mathadhipathis and Acharyas some take to singing, some to dance, some to play on musical instruments, even such as Tabla drums, some take to the rearing of birds and animals, some are found fond of chewing tobacco, eating musk pil&rsquo;s with betel nuts, addicted to scents and cairying gold snufi boxes and sticks with gold handles, themselves deched in silk cloths, some decked with jewels including those worn by women, some constantly attending cinemas and theatres, engrosed in naunch girls, and some even go to the length of entering into civil mannages with dancing gifls, in addition to the mairied wife, not</p>
<p>to speak of the great interest evinced by somein encouraging amoroussongs and a number of mischievous acts consisting of throwing Gulal powder on young females and pouring coloured water with silver and gold syringes during holy festivals, and some convicted for thefts and other criminal offences, while others are engaged in wasting public monies in personal comforts, pleasures and litigations and the enjoyment of high lite, where is the necessity to approach such Acharyas having such hobbies as stated above, no matter to whatever sect or religion they may belong</p>
<p>आचारस्य दवीयसा घनतृषामज्ञातवेदाध्वनाम्।<br>
कामातङ्ककलङ्कपङ्किलहृदा केषांचिदेषामपि॥</p>
<p>It is a source of some satisfaction that in one of the Vaishnava cults-Swaminarayana Sampradaya if any bad conduct is found in an Acharya, he is deposed and another substituted</p>
<p>It is regrettable to find the following description given by Ranganatharya, the author of Bhajayatırajam as regards some Gurus, in the light of his own observation He says—</p>
<p>तस्करजारविदूषकधूर्ता मस्करिमौनिदिगबरवृत्त।<br>
गुप्तसतीसुतधनमदमत्ता गुरव किं परवञ्चकचित्ता॥</p>
<p>Regarding professional Gurus in Viswagunadaisam we find that several of them do not care as to what kind of money they get so long as they amass wealth, as pointed out in the following—</p>
<p>हत्वा मार्गे द्विजादीनखिलमपि धनं हन्त हृत्वाऽतिदृप्ता<br>
दुर्वृत्तास्तस्करा ये वनगिरिनिलया ये च नीचा इहान्ये।<br>
कृत्वा चक्राङ्कामेषा झटिति विदधत किञ्च मन्त्रोपदेश<br>
तद्दत्तैरेववित्तैर्दधति तनुममी वशपारपरीत॥</p>
<p>And he further adds that some of the professional Acharyas are so fond of money as to take to the job of giving Panchasamskaras indiscriminately without taking into consideration the class of persons to whom they give the Samskaras In sloka 193 of the said book it is stated as under—</p>
<p>जाराश्चोरान् किरातान् जनपदमथनान् राजपाशान् महीशान् शिष्यान् कृत्वातिमत्ता</p>
<p>Means the shop of Samskara is opened to even highway robbers, hunters etc, whether deserving or not It has become something like rubber stamping work</p>
<p>Swami Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaj remarks in his book Satyarthaprakash</p>
<p>that by the mere burning of a particular portion of the body, a man cannot get salvation, in connection with the Mantra. <strong>अतप्ततनोर्न तदामो अश्नुते</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The assumed despatch work.</strong></p>
<p>No doubt it is the true charitable disposition to elevate the position of man from worst to worse and worse to bad and bad to good; just in the same manner as is being done to improve the conduct and character of even prisoners by the Discharged Prisoners Aid Society etc., associations and it is also natural that budmashes and rogues may expect to obtain Swarga and Moksha and therefore it is a good job of making money for several professional Acharyas by giving Panchasamskaras etc., in the name of despatching them for salvation; but one has to see how far these. priests are capable of enabling the low ordered men and criminals to obtain salvation when these Acharyas themselves are not capable of securing salvation owing to their being merged in Maya.</p>
<p>Behold with what result the ignorant man merges himself in Maya in his younger days being extremely attached to his family and suffers afterwards as observed in the following sloka:—</p>
<p>कश्चन लोके करपुटपात्रः पातुं सुतमाश्रितमठसत्रः।<br>
तस्मिन् वृद्धे सति सकलत्रः शपति हि रण्डासुत इति पुत्रः॥</p>
<p>Thus having taken even to the life of a beggar by receiving alms in his palms and living in Matams and Satrams, by sacrificing all self-respect for the sake of his family and progeny, the deluded man gets the reward of abuses in his old age by his own son and daughter-in-law or wife and son who call him—<strong>रण्डा पुत्रः (मुण्डाकोडुका</strong> in Telugu.) What a horrible sore disappointment!</p>
<p>The author of Viswagunadarsam also remarks in his book, sloka 146 consistent with the observation of Sankara&rsquo;s <strong>उदरनिमित्तं बहु कृत वेषः</strong> that certain Acharyas make a show by exhibiting a number of idols in the name of worship without realising the Oneness of That One God.</p>
<p>जडं गुरुरिति भ्रमन् श्रयति पुस्तकाडंवरैः।<br>
बहूपकरणान्वितैः बहुलविग्रहाराधनैः॥</p>
<p>The following Stanza is also worthy of note in bringing out the ignorance that prevails in both the so called Guru and Sishya:—</p>
<p>उभावप्यश्रुतग्रन्थौउभावपि जडात्मकौ।<br>
अहो मोहस्य माहात्म्यं तत्रैकः शिष्यतां गतः॥</p>
<p>Both are unacquainted with Shastric lore and both are immersed in ignorance. Oh; The power of delusion, that one chooses to become a disciple of the other!</p>
<p>One must understand that the technical and titular Gurus cannot be real Gurus as mentioned in Visvagunadarsa.</p>
<p>संकेतेनैव सिद्धं तदिदमविदुषां श्लाघ्यमाचार्यपुंस्त्वम्॥</p>
<p>What a wonder it is that although, there are many highly qualified great yogin-like persons available for being made Gurus yet people have a fancy to make several disqualified persons as Gurus simply because they are descendants of a particular Acharya as will be found in the following sloka:—</p>
<p>अमलमतिषु लोके जागरूकेष्वनेके<br>
ष्वपिनिजगुरुवंशोत्पत्तिमेवावलोक्य।<br>
निगदशुभचरित्रं वेदशास्त्रानभिज्ञं<br>
कमपि गुरुरितीमे कष्टमाराधयन्ति॥</p>
<p>It is essential to consider the qualifications of Real Gurus. The following is the ideal of a real Guru. Look at the descriptions of the greatest Sadguru Dakshinamoorthy given by Sri Sankaracharya:—</p>
<p>यस्यैव स्फुरणं सदात्मकमसत्कल्पार्थकं भासते<br>
साक्षात्तत्त्वमसीति वेदवचसा यो बोधयत्याश्रितान्।</p>
<p>यत्साक्षात्करणाद्भवेन्नपुनरावृत्तिर्भवाम्भोनिधौ<br>
तस्मै श्रीगुरुमूर्तये नम इदं श्रीदक्षिणामूर्त्तये॥</p>
<p>Meaning The real Guru is he, who is capable ot making his followers realise the truth and instil in their hearts Oneness with the Almighty and who is capable of actually saving them from the cycle of rebirths (For further noble qualities of Guru I refer to Sri Dakshinamoorthy Stotram by Sri Sankaracharya)</p>
<p>देह प्राणमपीन्द्रियाण्यपि चला बुद्धि च शून्य विदु<br>
स्त्रीबालान्धजडोपमास्त्वहमिति भ्रान्ता भृश वादिन।<br>
मायाशक्तिविलासकल्पितमहाव्यामोहसंहारिणे<br>
तस्मै श्री गुरुमूर्त्तये नम इदं श्रीदक्षिणामूर्त्तये॥</p>
<p>He, who is competent and pleased to impress. on the minds of men that the self or I-ness is not identical with the body and the senses which are of a very transitory character and who is able to destroy all infatuation due to Maya and thus leads the people towards the knowledge of Truth is the real Guru.</p>
<p>अज्ञाननाशने दक्ष दीक्षित भक्तरक्षणे।<br>
वटमूलाश्रय त्र्यक्ष दक्षिणामूर्तिमाश्रये॥</p>
<p>Definition and the qualities of a Guru:—</p>
<p>गकारः सिद्धिदः प्रोक्तो रेफः पापस्य हारकः।<br>
उकारो विष्णुरव्यक्तस्त्रितयात्मा गुरुः परः॥</p>
<p>शान्तोदान्तः कुलीनश्च विनीतश्शुद्धवेषवान्।<br>
शुद्धाचारः सुप्रतिष्ठः शुचिर्दक्षः सुबुद्धिमान्॥</p>
<p>आश्रमी ध्याननिष्ठश्च मन्त्रतन्त्रविशारदः।<br>
निग्रहानुग्रहे शक्तो गुरुरित्यभिधीयते॥</p>
<p>A Guru is extolled as one opening the eyes of persons blinded by ignorance in the following sloka:—</p>
<p>अज्ञानतिमिरान्धस्य ज्ञानाञ्जनशलाकया।<br>
चक्षुरुन्मीलितं येन तस्मै श्रीगुरवे नमः॥</p>
<p>Approach such a Guru as is described above without being deluded by professional Gurus.</p>
<p>Note that in view of preventing vagaries of persons calling themselves gurus and misleading the innocent people, the Almighty was pleased to assume the form of Guru Dattatreya with the highest qualified ideal of celibate life representing the Trinity for the spiritual elevation of mankind. Even among Vaishnavas we find that Sanyasins</p>
<p>take their Ashrama in the temple of Dattatreya at Melkote and other places.</p>
<p>If one is unable to procure a proper Guru the best thing will be to submit to the Lord of Universe, the Great God and obtain Mantropadesam from Him who will surely inspire in your mind the utility of the Mantra.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to note that Sri Ramanujacharya, the founder of Visishtadvaita School of philosophy took the holy orders from the hands of the Lord Varadaraja of Kanchi (Conjeevaram) and not from the hands of any mortal. In other words Sri Ramanujacharya was initiated by God Varadaraja Himself.</p>
<p>It would appear that even now the tradition holds that men seeking initiation but unable to come across a proper Guru betake themselves to the temple of Dakshinamoorthy and choose Him as their Guru by uttering the mantras in His presence in the Rock Fort Temple at Trichinopoly.</p>
<p>The Tamil Saint Perialvar confirms this view by saying _(&lt;MISSING_FIG href=&quot;../books_images/U-IMG-17247569057827.png&quot;/&gt;)viz. the Lord Vishnu Himself comes there to initiate the deserving disciple in the form of earthly Guru.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the best thing is to think and meditate upon that Guru of Gurus,</p>
<p>Lord Govinda, the Supreme Teacher of Gita and get necessary knowledge and wisdom inspired by Him with mantras, tantras and yantras and obtain eternal salvation in Vaikuntha, Kailasa, Goloka, or other lokas according to the different creeds</p>
<p>सच्चिदानन्दरूपाय कृष्णायाक्लिष्टकारिणे।<br>
नमो वेदान्तवेद्याय गुरवे बुद्विसाक्षिणे॥</p>
<p>Thus we must pray to that God Sachchidananda, Krishna as our Guru</p>
<p>He is the true Guru as stated in Gajendramoksha—</p>
<p>यदक्षर ब्रह्म वदति सर्वग निशाम्य यन्मृत्युमुखात्प्रमुच्यते।<br>
तमीश्वर युक्तमनुत्तमैर्गुणै सनातन लोकगुरु स्मरामि॥</p>
<p>In Anusmriti also we find a reference to that Loka Guru, the real Jagad Guru as per following sloka—</p>
<p>पर पुराण परम पवित्र पुराणमीश सुरलोकनाथम्।<br>
सुरासुरैरचितपादपद्म सनातन लोकगुरु स्मरामि॥</p>
<p>I give hereunder the slokas relating to the genealogies of different Acharyas, who are also called Gurus in view of their having inculcated different main schools of philosophic thought among the followers of Hinduism.</p>

<p>It is an admitted fact that Guru is required for removing your Avidya But if he himself is immersed in1 Avidya and delusion such Guru is of no use The popular saying <strong>विद्या गुरूणां गुरुः</strong> clearly indicates that the knowledge is the Guru of all Gurus Note also the fact that the God is the Guru of all Gurus and the Greatest Guru as stated in Vishnu Sahasranama—</p>
<p>गुरुर्गुरुतमो धाम सत्यः सत्य पराक्रमः॥</p>
<p><strong>Wrong Bhakti</strong></p>
<p>What a pity that certain section of Vaishnavas in advancing Bhakti or devotion have gone to the extent of mixing up the ideas of sexual love</p>
<p>between certain Gurus and disciples which are still in vogue without being condemned and eradicated by eminent thinkers of religion and devotion</p>
<p>It will be surprising to find that some of these Vaishnavas in dealing with devotion describe various details pertaining to sexual enjoyments such as kissing, drinking the lip–nectar, embracing and the sexual intercourse of the Goddess with God as if the God and the Goddess can be reduced to the level of an ordinary man and that of an animal Claiming to be a woman before God by acknowledging one&rsquo;s own weakı ess in the name of Nayaka Nayikibhavam is one thing but this ought not to make anybody indulge in the description of the animal sexual life between God and Goddess The following 9 forms of devotion do not inculcate such vulgar ideas</p>
<p>श्रवण कीर्तन विष्णो स्मरण पादसेवनम्।<br>
अर्चन वन्दन दास्य सव्यमात्मनिवेदनम्॥</p>
<p>Even in the following sloka describing eight forms of devotion we do not find such silly ideas—</p>
<p>तद्भक्तजनवात्सल्य पूजाया चानुमोदनम्।<br>
सुमना अर्चयेन्नित्य तदर्थे दम्भवर्जनम्॥</p>
<p>तत्कथाश्रवणे रागस्तदर्थे चाह्नविक्रिया।<br>
तदनुस्मरण नित्यं यस्तन्नाम्नोपजीवति॥<br>
भक्तिरष्टविधा ह्येषा</p>
<p>(गोतमीयतन्त्रे)</p>
<p>It is deplorable that they speak with the greatest delight in describing the love between God and Goddess (Radha and Krishna) in a form which is hardly decent Where is the necessity for men or women to indulge in the descript on of sexual pleasures between God and Goddess which are fallen to the lot of man and beast alike as per the saying <strong>आहारनिद्राभयमैथुनं च सामान्यमेतत् पशुभिर्नराणाम्</strong>, and hence this ought to have nothing to do in the sphere of innocent and holy devot on and high morality It is surprising that all requisites for devotion such as the ideal of renunciation, the ideal of service, the ideal of awe and reverence and the ideal of surrender before the Lord of Vaikuntha are totally abandoned To get one&rsquo;s self merged in the description of sexual pleasures and desires in the name of devotion, is nothing short of complete ignorance and subjecting one&rsquo;s own self to the abject influence of sexual ideas and exc tements is certainly not the correct method of devotion The following instance given in Radhika Stotram known as &ldquo;Premamruta Rasayana&rdquo;</p>
<p>in one of the Vallabha Sampradaya works known as Brihatstotra Sarıt Sagara part 2, will point out the vagueries of this aspect of the so-called devotion which lays stress on sexual enjoyments and details relating thereto, including reference to postures</p>

नानाकेलिकथाभिज्ञा सर्वदा यौवनोन्मदा॥</p>
<p>Can there be a worse method of insulting the Goddess by thus describing her to be engaged in sexual love of practising the 84 Bandhas or postures of intercourse when she is our Universal Mother? <strong>(लोक माता)</strong> Could it be a fact? Would we describe our natural mother in similar terms?</p>
<p>Conisder the lofty meaning of the word Radha from its derivation</p>
<p>रा इत्यादानवचनो धा च निर्वृतिवाचक।<br>
यया प्राप्नोति मुक्तिंच साच राधा प्रकीर्तिता॥</p>
<p>Is it proper even to imagine the thoughtless thought by describing her as one engrossed in sexual enjoyment when She is the giver of salvation?</p>
<p>Radha is worshipped by Radha Sahasranama found in Narada Pancharatra as also by the other Radha Sahasranama given in Radha Tantra just in the same manner as the Lakshmi Sahasranama, Lalita Sahasranama etc</p>
<p>Another absurdity of the peculiar Bhakti cult may be noticed in the disregard of Sandhya, Japa, Homa, Brahma Yajna, Tarpana etc, as may be evident from the <strong>स्वामिनी प्रार्थना</strong> Brihatstotra Sarıt Sagara, 2nd part</p>
<p>Thus to discourage the observance of Daily Prayers ordained by all Shastras and the study of Vedas is not at all advisable especially when so many foreign influences are already working against our Hindu Religion</p>
<p>Already Messrs A B C D &amp; Co have monopolised the whole field of intellect and literature to such an extent that a large number of educated men are devoid of Sanskrit and Vedic knowledge and cannot express Veda Mantras properly and fluently in spite of having high university degrees</p>
<p>I give the following Chatu sloka that deals with the A B C D Mahatmya, which shows to what extent it leads after having destroyed our mother language, our biblical knowledge, our homely life and our noble Dharma</p>
<p>वेदा सजातखेदाश्रुतिरपि मृतिमापास्ति किं शास्त्रजाल<br>
ए बी सी डीति पाठो जगति विजयने सर्वत कालदोषात्।<br>
कन्यादानम्य पात्र नतु निगमविद किं तु बी ए समर्था<br>
एम् ए एम् एल परीक्षास्वविगतयशस पङ्क्तिमाद्या विशन्ति॥</p>
<p>We know the fate of a large number of graduates that seek the employment of even attender&rsquo;s post with hundreds of applications and yet the above fuss mentioned in the sloka in praise of English language!</p>
<p><strong>Non-difference between Guru and Disciple<br>
Non-duality A Speciality</strong></p>
<p>It will be interesting to observe that after the disciple undergoes the necessary Samskaras by offering the sacrifice of all the 24 elements from the body and becomes highly qualified by being initiated in the right royal keen spiritual knowledge of Brahman and having been directed to give up all ideas of I-ness (ego) and my-ness viz <strong>अहन्ता</strong> and <strong>ममता</strong> and after the disciple realises the impor</p>
<p>tance of Hamsassoham <strong>(हंमः सोहम्)</strong> the Guru will find no difference between himself and his disciple The Guru then has to address the diciple <strong>तत्वमसि</strong> and prostrate before the diciple as per following—</p>
<p>आत्मस्वरूपं तं मत्वा प्रणमेत् शिरसा गुरु।</p>
<p>The following is the Mantra while offering Namaskara to a disciple by the Guru—</p>
<p>नमस्तुभ्यं नमो मह्यं तुभ्यं मह्यं नमो नमः।<br>
त्वमेव तत्तत्वमेव विश्वरूप नमोस्तुते॥</p>
<p>I give the above to give a clear idea of the ideal identification with Brahman.</p>
<p>The idea of equality between a Guru and Sishya is corresponding to the ideal of democracy No more autocracy, much less hypocrisy or sacerdotal bureaucracy</p>
<p><strong>Superiority of Parents and Husband to<br>
Gurus and Acharya</strong></p>
<p>The parents viz the Father and the Mother are superior to a Guru The Shastras repeatedly proclaim <strong>मातृदेवो भव, पितृदेवो भव</strong> and Acharya comes in the last It is said—</p>
<p>भूप्रदक्षिणषट्केन काशीयात्राशतेन च।<br>
यत्फलं लभते मर्त्ये तत्फलं मातृवन्दने॥</p>
<p>नान्नोदकसमं दानं नैका (नद्वा) दया पर व्रतम्।<br>
न गायत्र्या परो मंत्र न मातुर्दैवत परम्॥</p>
<p>The virtue that a man acquires by the six circumambulations of the Earth, by a hundred pilgrimages to Kasi is acquired by a single prostration before the Mother</p>
<p>No charity is higher than giving food and water No religious observance is higher than the Ekadasifast No Mantra is higher than Gayatriand no higher God than the Mother</p>
<p>As regards Father he is revered as follows—</p>
<p>पिता धर्मः पिता स्वर्गः पिता हि परमं तपः।<br>
पितरि प्रीतिमापन्ने सर्वाः प्रीयन्ति देवता॥</p>
<p>शरीरजनकश्चैव पिता ब्रह्मोपदेशकः।<br>
देहकर्मप्रदस्साक्षात् उपास्य परमेश्वरः॥</p>
<p>The Father is the Dharma, Father is the heaven, and Father is the highest penance When the Father is pleased all the Gods are propitiated.</p>
<p>The Father is the originator of the body. He is the initiator of the son into the knowledge of Brahma He is actually the giver of body and the root–cause for the due discharge of religious duties He is therefore the highest god to be worshipped</p>
<p>Sri Rama though incarnation of God has set the splendid example of Pitri Bhakti as one of the highest principles of morality and duty inculcated in the great epic Sri Ramayana and has acquired a world wide reputation as such a dutiful son</p>
<p><strong>माता पिता चरणकमलेभ्यो नमः</strong> isthe expression always used in the commencement of all Poojas offered to God before offering Namaskara to Guru. The following Slokas regarding the adoration of parents will also be found interesting—</p>
<p>Prostration to Mother—</p>
<p>तनुरियमभिवृद्धि समवाप्यास्ते सर्वदेवताशक्तया।<br>
देव्या ययाऽविकलया मात्रे तस्मै नमोस्तु भगवत्यै॥</p>
<p>Prostration to Father—</p>
<p>एतत्पार्थिवदेह प्रादुरभूद्येन भगवता गुरुणा।<br>
सन्तु नमांसि सहस्र तस्मै सर्वज्ञ मूर्त्तये पित्रे॥</p>
<p>See what Shastras say regarding father—</p>
<p>मान्यः पूज्यश्च सर्वेभ्य सर्वेषां जनको भवेत्।<br>
अहो यस्य प्रसादेन सर्वान् पश्यति मानवः॥</p>
<p>A Father is called <strong>महागुरु</strong>. It is ordained by Shastras that it is the father, who has to give Brahmopadesam to a son and not others</p>
<p>Thus the parents are worshipped like God if not more than God as they are the visible Cause of our Existence, as the Cause of. Creation, the Brahman</p>
<p>In christianity God is called Father, and in Hinduism Goddess is addressed as Mother</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to point out as to how even God is less regarded when compared with parents as can be seen from the most popular history of Pundarika, who while shampooing the legs of his parents, God having seen his Pitri Bhakti, was pleased and appeared in the form of Sri Vitthalnatha Swami in Pandarpoor, when the young boy who would not divert his attention from the service offered to parents and therefore got hold of a brick lying by his side which was thrown in His front offering the same for a seat to be occupied by the God Sri Vitthalnatha who with great pleasure got up on the brick and stand even to this day attracting millions of people that go to worship Him from all parts of India and is popularly known as Pundarikavarada. May Pundarikasha help us!</p>
<p>It is a wonder to see why the Pada pooja with cash money is encouraged to add to the Moha of Sanyasins. It is ordained by Shastra</p>
<p>to perform the Pada Pooja of the parents, the mother and the father of course in preference to Acharyas but that is not attended to except on rare occasions, such as the performance of Samskaras, Vratas, etc, and such practice of the high religious order VIZ, the Pada Pooja to parents is chiefly observed in Telugu country</p>
<p><strong>Husband Worship</strong></p>
<p>Then we have to consider the question of ladies who have necessarily to perform Pada Pooja to their husband who is their Guru, Lord and God as per the following authority</p>
<p>भर्तादेवो गुरुर्भर्ता धर्मतीर्थव्रनाति च।<br>
तस्मात्सर्वं परित्यज्य पतिमेकं समर्चयेत्॥</p>
<p>न व्रतेनोपवासेन धर्मेण विविधेन च।<br>
नारी स्वर्गमवाप्नाति प्राप्नोति पतिपूजनात्।</p>
<p>(Sankha)</p>
<p>It is said that the lord husband has to be worshipped as per— <strong>शिवत्वेन पति ध्यात्वपूनयेद्दिव्यनामभिः</strong>Atri Smriti says.—<strong>शङ्करादपि विष्णोर्वा पतिरेवाधिकस्त्रिया</strong></p>
<p>For further particulars see my Patipujavidhan regarding Pati Pooja, Pati Bhaktı, PatiSeva etc.</p>
<p>When, thus salutation to the feet of parents and husband in preference to any Guru or Acharya is enjoined by the Shastras why encourage Pada Pooja to Acharyas and that too constantly with money instead of flowers!</p>
<p><strong>2 सत्कृतिकरणम्</strong></p>
<p>Satkriti— comprises Satkarma, performing Sandhya, Pooja, Vrata, Yaga, etc</p>
<p>Satkara— hospitality to guests and others</p>
<p>Sadvichara— bestowal and cultivation of good thoughts</p>
<p>Sadbodha— giving good advice free</p>
<p>Satkarya— doing good work</p>
<p>Sadbuddhi— developing good and noble mentality</p>
<p>Satsanga— association with good and virtuous people</p>
<p>Sadviniyoga— utilising and offering money for charity and other good purposes</p>
<p>Sadvartan— leading a good life with good actions</p>
<p>Sadachaia— practice of sacred custom— not the unnecessary agita</p>
<p>tion of forcibly shoving Panchamas into the interior of temples near the idols even against theirwill, before qualified</p>
<p><strong>3. सत्य वचनम्</strong></p>
<p>The value and importance of truth is stated as follows—</p>
<p>सत्यरूपं परं ब्रह्म सत्यं हि परम तपः।<br>
सत्यमृला क्रिया सर्वा सत्यात्परतरो नहि॥</p>
<p><strong>4 सद्धर्माचरणम्</strong></p>
<p>The important aspect of Saddharma is as under—</p>
<p>सत्यमेव व्रतं यस्य दया दीनेषु सर्वदा।<br>
कामक्रोधौ वशे यस्य तेन लोकत्रयं जितम्॥</p>
<p><strong>It is further said—</strong></p>
<p>स धन्य पुरुषो लोके स कृती परमार्थवित्।<br>
ब्रह्मनिष्ठ सत्यसन्धो यो भवेद्भुवि मानव॥</p>
<p><strong>5 श्री हरिचरणम् – THE FEET OF GOD.</strong></p>
<p>(a) Adoration at the feet of God</p>
<p>कदा पुन शङ्खरथाङ्गकल्पक-<br>
ध्वजारविन्दाङ्कुशवज्रलाञ्छनम्।</p>
<p>त्रिविक्रम त्वच्चरणाम्बुजद्वय<br>
मदीयमूर्धानमलकरिष्यति॥</p>
<p>(Stotra Ratnam Sloka 31)</p>
<p>Meaning when shall I have my head adorned by the feet of Lord Harı as described above</p>
<p><strong>(b) Particulars of the marks</strong></p>
<p>Dealing with the subject of the feet of Lord Govinda in the admiration of which every devotee is interested, I am tempted to give the following particulars of the marks (without dimensions for want of space) contained in the holy feet, the right foot having ten marks and the left nine, in all nineteen marks, as per the following from the Padmottara Khanda mentioned in Sri Krishna Pada Chihna Mahatmya, Chapter 12, in Brahma Vaivarta Purana</p>
<p>Brahma addressing Narada makes the following statement.—</p>
<p>ऊनविंशतिचिह्नानि मया दृष्टानि तत्पदे।<br>
दक्षिणे दश चिह्नानि वामे च नव नारद॥</p>
<p>ध्वजातपत्र कमल वज्राख्य चाकुशो यव।<br>
स्वस्तिक चोर्ध्वरेखा चाष्टकोण चक्रमेव च॥</p>
<p>चिह्नानि वामचरणे गोविन्दस्याद्भुतानि च।<br>
इन्द्रचाप त्रिकोण च कलश चार्धचन्द्रकम्॥</p>
<p>शंङ्कोऽम्बर मत्स्यचिह्न गोष्पद जाबव स्मृतम्।<br>
अङ्कान्येतानि भो विप्र दृश्यन्ते च यदा कदा॥</p>
<p>तदा तच्चिह्नितपाद अर्चन कुरुते यदि।<br>
राजसूयाश्वमेवादि फलं भवति सर्वथा॥</p>
<p><strong>(c) The colour of the Feet of God</strong></p>
<p>I now give a further beautiful Stanza dealing with the description of those tender, lotuscoloured auspicious feet of Lord Krishna which always find a place in the hearts of great Yogins producing the efficacy of giving Mukti and which have removed the pride of lotus flowers</p>
<p>नमस्यानिर्मृष्टाकुशलकुलयोस्ताम्रतलयो<br>
महायोगीन्द्राणां हृदयचरयोर्मुक्तिकरयोः।<br>
माविष्टश्रेष्ठद्विग्दगतयोर्विश्वनुतयो-<br>
रह लीये भिन्दत्कमलमदयोस्तेऽद्य पदयोः॥</p>
<p>(Vasudevanandini)</p>
<p><strong>(d) The Mahatmyam of the Dust of the Feet of God.</strong></p>
<p><strong>न नाकपृष्ठ नच सार्वभौम न पारमेष्ठ्य न रसाधिपत्यम्।<br>
न योगसिद्धिर्नपुनर्भव वा वाञ्छन्ति यत्पादरजः प्रपन्नाः॥</strong></p>
<p>The real devotees of the Almighty do not care for the pleasures of paradise or to secure the acquisition of kingdom or the office of Brahma or the attainment of Siddhis or even the absence of rebirths but aspire for the Dust of the Feet of God.</p>
<p><strong>(e) The description of the full leg of God</strong></p>
<p>I give the splendid description given of the whole huge leg of that Lord of Universe, whose feet were adored by Brahma and other Gods at the time He assumed the form of Trivikramavatara</p>
<p>The following <strong>पाददण्ड वर्णन</strong>given in Dasakumara Charitram in its Mangala Sloka is surely deserving of our high appreciation and admiration</p>
<p>ब्रह्माण्डच्छत्रदण्डः शतधृतिभवनाम्भोरुहो नालदण्डः<br>
क्षोणीनौकूपदण्डः क्षरदमरसरित्पट्टिकाकेतुदण्डः।<br>
ज्योतिश्चक्राक्षदण्डस्त्रिभुवनविजयस्तम्भदण्डोऽड्घ्रिदण्डः<br>
श्रेयस्त्रैविक्रमस्ते वितरतु विवुधद्वेषिणा कालदण्डः॥</p>
<p><strong>(f) Prostration at the Feet of God in feminine form</strong></p>
<p>I think I should take advantage of further prostrating before the Feet of the Almighty who is also adored in the feminine form Thus I give</p>
<p>the prayer of the Feet of Goddess Kamakshi given in Mookapanchasatı in the well–known Padaravindasatakim—</p>
<p>कवित्वश्रीमिश्रोकरणनिपुणौ रक्षणचणौ<br>
विपन्नानां श्रीमन्नलिनमसृणौ शोणकिरणौ।<br>
मुनीन्द्राणामन्तःकरणसरणौ मजुसरणौ<br>
मनोज्ञौ कामाक्ष्या दुरितहरणौनौमि चरणौ॥</p>
<p>Not being content with the above Stanzas in praise of the Feet of the Almighty I should like to give one more Stanza dealing with the feet of the Mother Goddess who looks at us,the humble devotees-with all the maternal love for our protection</p>
<p>त्वदन्य पाणिभ्यामभयवरदो दैवतगण<br>
त्वमेका नैवासि प्रकटितवराभीत्यभिनया।<br>
भयात्त्रातु दातुं फलमपि च वाञ्छासमधिक<br>
शरण्ये लोकानां तव हि चरणावेव निपुणौ॥</p>
<p>(Soundarya Lahari Slo 4)</p>
<p><strong>(g) The Mahatmyam of the Dust of the Feet of Goddess</strong></p>
<p><strong>पादरजो माहात्म्यम्</strong></p>
<p>तनीयास पांसु तव चरणपङ्केरुहभव<br>
विरिञ्चिस्सञ्चिन्वन्विरचयति लोकानविकलम्।</p>
<p>वहत्येन शौरि कथमपि सस्त्रेण शिरसा<br>
हरस्सड्क्षुद्यैन भजति भसितोद्धूलनविधिम्॥</p>
<p>(Soundarya Laharı)</p>
<p>By putting a small quantity of the dust of the lotus–like feet of Goddess, Brahma becomes able to do the work of creation Vishnu carrying the dust on his thousands of heads does his part of the work of protection, and Siva applying the sud dust on the whole of his body reduces the whole world into dust</p>
<p>** (h) God&rsquo;s Foot Water**</p>
<p><strong>पाद तीर्थम्</strong></p>
<p>Connected with the dearest of all dear things to be retained in the hearts of all viz the feet of my Lord, the Lord of all the numerous Universes is the sacred Teertha of His Feet</p>
<p>Delightfully do I give the splendid Stanza for taking the delicious <strong>पाद तीर्थ</strong> Pada Teertha of God which is the holiest of all holy waters, holier than all holy rivers, full of all virtues, on the drop of which when taken or put in your mouth with the holiest of holy leaves, the holy basil sometimes. containing the splendid fragrance of saffron and purified camphor, you are bound to be taken to</p>
<p>heaven provided of course your devotion for Him is really real Remember that there is nothing equal to the sacred reertha for purifying your mind and soul, for destroying your sins and for giving you salvation A few drops of the sacred Teertha is the best medicine which cannot be secured by all researches in all the laboratories of the world by any Platonic scientist It is the richest and the priceless medicine nct for diseases but a real cure for deceases A sure remedy for unostentatious religious men giving much longer lease than the leases of 999 years at least for enjoing the celestial pleasures of Devalokas before actual final Mukti</p>
<p>Firstly I give the Veda Mantra that can be used for taking the Pada Theertha of God or even Mahaprasada of God on which Vidyaranya has dealt with his commentary.</p>
<p>तदस्य प्रियमभि पाथोअश्याम्–नरोयत्रदेवयवोमदन्ति<br>
उरुक्रमस्य सहिबन्धु रित्था–विष्णो पदेपरमेमध्वउत्स॥</p>
<p>The following is the Stanza from Brahmanda Purana which deals with the Mahatmya of Pada Theertha of the Holy God—</p>
<p>गंगापुष्कर नर्मदाच यमुना गोदावरी गोमती<br>
तुंगाद्वारवती प्रयागबदरी वाराणसी सिंधुभि।</p>
<p>कन्यासेतु सरस्वती प्रभृतिभि ब्रह्माण्डमध्ये जले<br>
तीर्थस्नानमनन्तकोटिफलदं श्रीविष्णु पादोदकम्॥</p>
<p><strong>(2) Vedic Mantras on the feet of God and Padodaka</strong></p>
<p>१. चरणं पवित्रं विततं पुराणं येन पूतस्तरति दुष्कृतानि।<br>
तेन पवित्रेण शुद्धेन पूता अतिपाप्मानमराति तरेम॥</p>
<p>२. लोकस्य द्वारमर्चिमत्पवित्रं ज्योतिष्मद्भाजमानमहम्वत्।<br>
अमृतस्य धारा बहुधा दोहमान चरण नो लोके सुधिता दधातु॥</p>
<p>(तै ब्रा ३-३२-३ )</p>
<p>These Mantras are useful for the worship of the feet of God, and they are used in offering Padyam in Sraddha and in praise of Sudarsana by Vaishnavas who also use during the commencement of Asirvadam</p>
<p>If further information is required regarding the value and importance of the feet of Almighty I refer to the Slokas given in the &ldquo;Vakya Vritti&rdquo; in Stotra Ratnakaram and other works</p>
<p><strong>(1) Complete submission at the Feet of God</strong></p>
<p>Look at the humblest and sincerest method of submission to the Great God and the confessions made of the follies and failings one is bound to commit at least to some extent and the catholic manner in which one begs to Almighty to excuse</p>
<p>him of all or any of them and enable him to secure the merit for obtaining salvation by worshipping His Feet.</p>
<p>अमर्याद क्षुद्रश्चलमतिरसूयाप्रसवभू<br>
कृतघ्नो दुर्मानीस्मरपरवशो वञ्चनपर।</p>
<p>नृशंस पापिष्ठ कथमहमितो दुःखजलवे-<br>
रपारादुत्तीर्णस्तव परिचरेय चरणयो॥</p>
<p>The above Stanza is quite in conformity with the prayer offered during the time of circumambulation to God at the end of Pooja by stating—</p>
<p>पापोहं पापकर्माहं पापात्मा पापसंभव।<br>
त्राहि मां कृपया देव शरणागतवत्सल॥</p>
<p>Some of the devotees however having true convictions of their own do not care to make such admissions and consider that there is no necessity for the same as they do not like to be called sinners and hence giving expression to such utterance is not liked by them I therefore feel that the sloka be modified as under in regard to such special cases—</p>
<p>पुण्योऽहं पुण्यकर्माहं पुण्यात्मा पुण्यसंभव।</p>
<p><strong>Form of Prostrating at the Feet of Hari.</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the manner in which the Feet of the Almighty have to be worshiped by several sets of thousard names each (Sahasranamas) and sometimes even by a lakh of names with 108 and more varieties of beautiful flowers and the sacred holy basil and the other sacred and scented leaves, one has to offer his prayers in the humblest form according to the description given below with real devotion, real attachment, real submission, real obedience and real faithfulness without playing any tricks even with God as is done by manv Purohits and Archakas and thus prostrate at His feet</p>
<p>बद्धेन्नाञ्जलिना नतेन शिरसा गात्रै सरोमोदमै<br>
कण्ठेन स्वरगद्गदेन नयनेनोद्गीर्णबाप्पाम्बुना।<br>
नित्यं त्वच्चरणारविन्दयुगलध्यानामृतास्वादिना-<br>
मस्माकं सरसीरुहाक्ष सतत सपद्यता जीवितम्॥</p>
<p>I further give the formula of making prostration before God viz, Namaskara as the same is worth observing by devotees—</p>
<p>उरसा शिरसा दृष्ट्या मनसा वचसा तथा।<br>
पद्भ्यां कराभ्यांजानुभ्यां प्रणामोऽष्टाङ्ग ईरित॥</p>
<p>One has to prostrate before God by the chest, by the head, by the eyes, by mind, by speech, by the legs, by the folded hands and by the knees bent Thus the eight elements are required for a proper Namaskara or prostration The happy and sublime result of such Namaskara is as under—</p>
<p>भूमौ निपत्य य कुर्यात् कृष्णेऽष्टाङ्गनति सुधी।</p>
<p>सहस्रजन्मज पापं त्यक्त्वा वैकुण्ठमाप्नुयात्॥</p>
<p><strong>Name of God-Hari</strong></p>
<p>Having dealt with the subject of Hai Charanam, I proceed to point out the importance and the value of the word Hari</p>
<p>The popular name of Hari is known to all as the dcstroyer of sins as per saying <strong>हरिर्हरति पापानि</strong>,</p>
<p>It is needless to point out the value of the name Hari in this age of Kalı as stated below—</p>
<p>हरेर्नाम हरेर्नाम हरेर्नामैव केवलम्।<br>
कलौ नास्त्येव नास्त्येव नास्त्येव गतिरन्यथा॥</p>
<p>But having regard to the unnecessary <strong>query</strong> put by the people merged in worldly <strong>worries</strong> being engaged in lands, Khushki and <strong>Tarı</strong> and finding large amounts for payments of <strong>Vari</strong>and coming across people acting like <strong>Nari,</strong> and many</p>
<p>a Brahmin found fond of eating <strong>Kari,</strong> and taking to the taste of spiced <strong>Curry,</strong> vitamin advocates engaged in eating <strong>Berry</strong> and <strong>Cherr</strong>y, though others indulge in eating <strong>Poori</strong> and <strong>Kachori,</strong> and generally possessing the pride of wealth <strong>Verri</strong>, where is the time to think of <strong>Hari?</strong> But remember that all Civilized acts done in <strong>hurry</strong> contribute towards causing your death also in <strong>hurry</strong> and you are never free to think of <strong>HariBury</strong> all your infatuated ideas to be always <strong>merry</strong> but devote yourself to <strong>Hari</strong> Do not always be fond of driving in <strong>Garry</strong> and ever be anxious to see your wife <strong>carry</strong> and keep on fondly longing to seethe children <strong>marry</strong> disregarding the sufferings that make you feel <strong>sorry,</strong> but think of Lord <strong>Hari</strong> Unless you detach yourself from <strong>Pari</strong>however much <strong>Sundari</strong> and take to <strong>Dari,</strong> how can you get salvation at the feet of Lord <strong>Hari?</strong> Nothing like seeking the help of <strong>Hari</strong> as Sri Sankara has sought by addressing Him as <strong>Murari</strong> (Vide stanza 4 of this book)</p>

संसारतारी, नरकान्तकारी, कल्याणकारी<br>
दशावतारी, यमुना विहारी, गिरिराजधारी<br>

<p>(Hero of all heroes before whom all are zeros)</p>
<p>Save us, bless us and confer all bliss on us</p>
<p><strong>6 भवभय हरणम्</strong></p>
<p>The prostration at the feet of God is a real medicine to obtain relief from the fear of worldly bonds It is the real solace and a true instrument for obtaining salvation See the following—</p>
<p>भवत्पादाभोज भवजलधिपोत भजति य<br>
ससंसाराब्धि तरति तरतीत्येव निगमः।</p>
<p><strong>7 खलु तव मरणम्</strong></p>
<p>जातस्यहि ध्रुवो मृत्युः ध्रुवं जन्म मृतस्य च॥</p>
<p>(Guta 2-17)</p>
<p>देहिनोऽस्मिन् यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा।<br>
तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिः धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति॥ (</p>
<p>(Bhagavad Gita, Chap 2 Slo 13)</p>
<p>To whoever is born, death is certain and birth is as certin to whoever dies, unless one is specialised in the art of securing salvation</p>
<p>Remember that you do not allow sins to accumulate by your misdeeds, lest,</p>
<p>यमकिंकरकरशुले लोले पतदभिघातविपाले फाले।<br>
दहति तनु प्रतिकूले काले क रमयसि तत्काले बाले॥</p>
<p>(Bhaja Yathi Rajam)</p>
<p>So avoid the rigorous punishments that will be inflicted on you as stated above by the beatings you will receive on your forehead, by the piercing of the Sula (trident) and by being thrown into the burning fire by the servants of Yama</p>

सङ्कटहरणं संपत्करणं तस्य स्मरणे नहि नहि मरणम्॥</p>
<p>Lodd Govindas</p>
<p>भज गोविन्दं भज गोविन्दं गोविन्दं भज मूढमते॥४३॥</p>
<p>Take shelter under Lord Vishnu who is the holder of the world, and the Lord of Lakshmi, who enables men to swim across the sea of Samsara, who removes calamities and confers prosperity By the bestowal of your thought on the glorious Lord Vishnu you will never, never be affected by the tortures of Yama(43)</p>
<p>Note what is stated in Tait Upanishad 11 8 1—</p>
<p><strong>भीषास्माद्वातः पवते भीषोदेति सूर्यः।<br>
भीषास्मादग्निश्चेन्द्रश्च मृत्युर्धावति पञ्चम इति॥</strong></p>
<p>Meaning Yama will run away from you owing to the terror of Almighty Vishnu From His fear the wind blows, from His fear the sun rises, from His fear fire burns, from His fear Indra pours water and fifthly Yama likewise runs away from His terror</p>
<p>Pary to Lord Govinda</p>
<p>Prayto Lord Govinda Pray to Lord Govinda,<br>
Oh Ignorant and foolish-minded man</p>
<p><strong>1 लक्ष्मी रमणम्</strong></p>
<p>रमाया रमणस्थानंराम रामविदो विदुः।<br>
रमया रमने सार्धतेन रामविदुर्बुधा॥</p>
<p>Hence prostrate before Lakshmi Ramana-Sri Rama</p>
<p><strong>2 धरणी धरणम्</strong></p>
<p>The rame of Dharanidharana is given to Lord Vishnu for various reasons viz because on account of His having held up the world in the form of Varaha and also in view of His holding this world along with other worlds in His body The marvellous aspect of the wonderful scientific arrangement made by Vishnu, the Lord of Universe is evident from the fact of the power of gravitation given to this as also the</p>
<p>other worlds working with their different rotations and revolution but for which splendid arrangement the several worlds visible through huge telescopes and non-visible, may dash with each other and smash into pieces</p>
<p>अह सवर्तको वह्निरनिलो वरणीधरः॥</p>
<p>(Vishnu Sahasranama)</p>
<p><strong>३ विष्णु शरणम्</strong></p>
<p>शरणत प्रपन्नाये ध्यानयोग विवर्जिता।<br>
तेऽपिमृत्युमतिक्रम्य यान्ति तद्वैष्णवं पदम्॥</p>
<p>Those that submit to Lord Vishnu and surrender unto Him will be able to fight out Yama or His messengers and obtain bliss Hence the following sloka—</p>
<p>कार्यक्रियाकारणमप्रमेय हिरण्यबाहु वरपद्मनाभम्।<br>
महाबल वेदनिधि सुरोत्तम व्रजामि विष्णु शरण जनार्दनम्॥</p>
<p>(Gajendramoksha Slo 82 )</p>
<p>There is no greater object that can be achieved in this world than that of entirely submitting to God, Almighty and seeking shelter under His feet</p>
<p>In the following four Charama Slokas, which are considered to be the most important devotional</p>
<p>keynotes for securing protection at the hands of God who has made the following promises during His several incarnations</p>
<p>As <strong>Krishna</strong> He assures—</p>
<p>सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेक शरणं व्रज।<br>
अहं त्वां सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मां शुच॥</p>
<p>(Srimad Bhagavad Gita)</p>
<p>As <strong>Rama</strong> He assures—</p>
<p>सकृदेव प्रपन्नाय तवास्मीति च याचने।<br>
अभयं सर्वभूतेभ्यो ददाम्येतद्व्रतं मम॥</p>
<p>(Sri Ramayana )</p>
<p>As <strong>Varaha</strong> He assures—</p>
<p>स्थितेमनसि सुस्वस्थेशरीरेपिच यो नर।<br>
धातुसाम्ये स्थिते स्मर्ता विश्वरूपं च मामजम्॥</p>
<p>ततस्तम्रियमाणन्तु काष्ठपाषाण सन्निभम्।<br>
अहं स्मरामि मद्भक्त नयामि परमां गतिम्॥</p>
<p>(Varaha Purana )</p>
<p>As <strong>Nrisimh</strong>a He assures—</p>
<p><strong>सत्यं ब्रवीमि मनुजा स्वयं मूर्ध्वबाहुः।<br>
योमा मुकुन्द नरसिंह जनार्दनेति॥</strong></p>
<p>जीवन् जपत्यनुदिनंमरणे ऋणीव ।<br>
पाषाणकाष्ठ सदृशाय ददामि मुक्तिम्॥</p>
<p>Hence the highest order of devotion is to entirely res gn unto Him because the Lord has made the Sankalpa and taken the vow of protection once for all for the sake of His devotees</p>
<p><strong>श्री कृष्ण शरणम्</strong></p>
<p>In view of the first Charama Sloka contained in Srimad Bhagavad Gita, perhaps Sri Vallabhacharya seems to have adopted the AshtakshariMantra of Sri Krishna known as <strong>श्री कृष्ण शरणं मम</strong></p>
<p>In addition to theKrishnashtakshariMantra <strong>श्री कृष्णं शरणं मम</strong>, prescribed by Sri Vallabhacharya, we find the original Krishnashtahshari Mantra with Bijaksharas given in Brahma Vaivarta Purana in Chapter 45, being the Mantra initiated by Mahadeva (Siva) to Manasa Devi, the presiding deity of Mantras, created by Brahma as per the following—</p>
<p>मन्त्राधिष्ठातृदेवीन्तांमनसा ससृजे तत।<br>
तपसा मनसा तेन बभूव मनसा च सा॥</p>
<p>This Manasa Devi, after having performed the pooja of Siva in Kailasa for thousand years obtain</p>
<p>ed the AshtakshariMantra of SriKrishna as per the following authority—</p>
<p>भक्त्या संपूज्य कैलासे तुष्टाव चन्द्रशेखरम्।<br>
दिव्य वर्षसहस्रञ्च तं सिषवे मुने सुता॥</p>
<p>आशुतोषो महेशश्च तस्यां तुष्टो बभूवह।<br>
महाज्ञानं ददौतस्यै पाठयामास साम च॥</p>
<p>कृष्णमन्त्र कल्पतरु ददावष्टाक्षर मुने।<br>
लक्ष्मी माया काम बीज डेऽन्त कृष्णपढ तदा॥</p>
<p>(श्री ह्रींक्लीं नम कृष्णाय )</p>
<p>Now I also give the Krishna Saranashtakam, which may be liked by the devotees seeking shelter under Him</p>
<p><strong>श्रीकृष्ण शरणाष्टकम्।</strong></p>
<p><strong>सर्वसाधनहीनस्यपराधीनस्यसर्वत।<br>
पापपीनस्यदीनम्य, श्रीकृष्ण शरण मम॥१॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>ससारसुखसंप्राप्तिसमुसखस्यविशेषत।<br>
बहिर्मुखस्यसतत, श्रीकृष्ण शरण मम॥२॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>सदा विषयकामस्य, देहारामस्य सर्वदा।<br>
दुष्टस्वभाववामस्य, श्रीकृष्ण शरण मम॥३॥</strong></p>
<p>ससारसर्पद्रष्टस्य, धर्मभ्रष्टस्य दुर्मते।<br>
लौकिकप्राप्तिकष्टस्य, श्रीकृष्ण शरणं मम॥४॥</p>
<p>विस्मृतस्वीयवर्मस्य, कर्ममोहितचेतस।<br>
स्वरूपज्ञानशून्यस्य, श्रीकृष्ण शरणं मम॥५॥</p>
<p>ससारसिंधुमग्नस्य भग्नभावस्य दुष्कृते।<br>
दुर्भावलग्नमनस, श्रीकृष्ण शरणं मम॥६॥</p>
<p>विवेकधैर्यभक्त्यादिरहितस्य निरन्तरम्।<br>
विरुद्धकरणासक्ते, श्रीकृष्ण शरणं मम॥७॥</p>
<p>विषयाक्रान्तदेहस्य, वैमुख्यहृतसन्मते।<br>
इन्द्रियाश्वगृहीतस्य, श्रीकृष्ण शरणं मम॥८॥</p>
<p>To me devoid of all means, ever dependant on others in every respect, fattened by sins, to my humble and poor self, Lord Krishna shall be the Refuge.</p>
<p>To me who am always hankering after worldly pleasures, and immersed in bodily comforts, and ill-natured and bitten by the Serpent of Samsara and fallen from virtue, may Lord Krishna be the Refuge</p>
<p>Forgetful of Religious duties that I am, blinded by worldly pursuits, ignorent of Self, drowned in the ocean of Samsara, full of disappoint</p>
<p>ments and engaged in misdeeds with my mind concentrated on evil thoughts devoid of discrimination fortitude and devotion and led away by the unbridled horses of sense organs, may Sri Krishna be my Refuge</p>
<p>I further point out the Panchaksharı Mantra of Sri Krishna, which is also a very valuable and sacred Mantra for the devotees of Krishna which may be used with great advantageIt is <strong>कृष्ण तवास्मि</strong></p>
<p>In Gautamiya Tantra it is said</p>
<p>सर्वेषु मन्त्रवर्गेषु श्रेष्ठो वैष्णव उच्यते।<br>
वैष्णवेषु च सर्वेषु कृष्णमन्त्रा फलाधिका॥</p>
<p>य स्मरेत सदा मन्त्र श्रीकृष्ण शरणं मम।<br>
अष्टाक्षरं जपेन्नित्यं यमो दृष्ट्वाहि शङ्कते॥</p>
<p>Of course we have got the much esteemed popular Ashtaksharı and Dvadasaksharı etc Vedic Mantras known as <strong>ॐ नमो नारायणाय, ॐ नमो भगवते वासुदेवाय</strong> and also the mantra <strong>ॐ नमोविष्णवे</strong> and all these are appl cable to the same Sri Maha Vishnu, Sri Krishna only, and onght to be used freely</p>
<p>As I think it will be interesting to give the Veda Mantra of Sri Krishna which occurs in Rig Veda and which having regard to the elasticity of Sanskrit language with its various</p>
<p>grammars and certain principles of Mecmamsa such as Sruti, Linga, Vakya, Prakarana etc, the Mantra can be used for Krishna just in the same manner as the Vedic Rama Mantra for Rama on which commentary also has been written</p>
<p>The Vedic Krishna Mantra</p>
<p>कृ॒ष्ण नि॒यान॒ हर॑य सुप॒र्णा अ॒पो वसा॑ना दिव॒मुत्प॑तन्ति।</p>
<p>त आव॑वृत्रन्त्सद॑नादृ॒तस्यादितू घृ॒तेन॑पृथि॒वी व्यु॑द्यते॥</p>
<p>(ऋग्वेद-अ ३ व २३ म १ अ २२ सू १६४ ऋक् ४७)</p>
<p>कृष्ण कृष्णपरमात्मान नियान नियन्तार उद्दिश्य (कामक्रोधादि) अरिषड्वर्गस्य हर्तार तथाभूत, सुपर्णा सु शोभन पर्ण पूरण (व्यापन इति यावत्) येषां ते तथोक्ता भगवत चैतन्याशा दैवी संपत्ति विशिष्टा जीवा इति यावत् अप शुक्ररूपा (आपो मे रेतसि श्रिता इति श्रुते) वसाना ऊर्ध्वरूपेण वारयन्त ऊर्ध्वरेतस इत्यर्थ दिवप्रकाशमान वैकुण्ठलोक उत्पतन्ति उद्दिश्य गच्छन्ति ते सज्जीवा ऋतस्य सदनात् पुण्यलोकात् आववृत्रन् आगतवन्त आदित् अत एव घृतेन तेषां पुण्येन पृथिवी इयंभूमि व्युद्यते विविध उद्यते सिक्ता सती सस्यादिभि आढ्या भवति। पूर्वं पुण्यलोकात् आगत्य स्वरूपवैभव सानिध्येन भूमि समृद्धा कृत्वा तदनु कृष्णोद्देशेन पुनरावृत्तिरहित वैकुण्ठं प्राप्नुवन्तीति भावः</p>
<p>The virtuous souls who have conquered the six inner enemies, who carry happiness wherever</p>
<p>theypervade and who by the control of passions have conserved their energy after coming to the Earth from the higher world and purifying the Earth by their presence and making it yield plenty of crops and the like for the benefit of mankind, march towards the Heaven to reach Lord Krishna, the Controller of the Universe, to such Krishna do I pray</p>
<p><strong>श्रीकृष्णस्मरणम्।</strong></p>
<p>The value of meditating upon Sri Krishna and his Mantra has been expounded as follows—</p>
<p>श्रीकृष्णमन्त्रस्मरणं मनोनैर्मल्यकारणम्।<br>
भिद्यते हृदयग्रन्थिश्छिद्यन्ने सर्वसंशयाः॥</p>
<p>Recollecting the small sloka composed by me about 40 years ago regarding Krishna Smaranam I take a delight in giving the same here which will also be found in my book Krishna Sandhya</p>
<p>कृष्णं स्मरामि भुवनत्रयसुन्दराङ्गम्<br>
वृन्दावनान्तचरमम्बुजकोमलाक्षम्।<br>
विष्णुं प्रपन्नजनचातककालमेघम्<br>
दीनार्तिखण्डनमखण्डविभूतिनाथम्॥</p>
<p>It is stated in Shastras—</p>
<p>सदा स्मरेत्य कृष्णं यमस्तस्य करोति किम्।<br>
भस्मीभवन्ति तस्याशु महापातकराशय॥</p>
<p>What can Yama do to him who always meditates upon Sri Krishna? Nothing, because all his sins are burnt down and reduced to ashes</p>
<p>प्रायश्चित्तान्यशेषाणि तप कर्मात्मकानि वै।<br>
यानितेषामशेषाणां कृष्णानुस्मरणं परम्॥</p>
<p>Note that the utterance of the word Krishna with godly devotion is capable of producing the virtues derived by repeating Vishnu Sahasranama thrice</p>
<p>नाम्नासहस्रं दिव्यानांत्रिरावृत्त्या तु यत्फलम्।<br>
एकावृत्त्या तु कृष्णस्य तत्फलं लभते नरः॥</p>
<p>(Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishnajanma Khanda 13-45-62)</p>
<p>The value of uttering the name of Krishna has been emphasised in Nrisimha Purana as follows.—</p>
<p>नारका कृष्ण कृष्णेति नारसिंहेति चुक्रुंशु।<br>
इति सकीर्तितो विष्णुर्नारकैर्भक्तिपूर्वकम्॥</p>
<p>नारक्यो यातनाः सर्वास्तेषां नष्टा महात्मनाम्॥</p>
<p>Sri Krishna, the particular name of Sri Maha Vishnu has acquired very great popularity and a</p>
<p>peculiar glory and high superiority of all the names of God Because out of the four kinds of Avataras, viz, Abhinnavatara, Bhinnavatara, Avishtavatara and Amsavatara, He is the fullest Avatara or Sampurnavatara as per the following authority found in Maha Bharata, Udyoga Parva</p>
<p>कृष्णो हि पूर्णकलया सभूतो लोकगुप्तये।<br>
मत्स्याद्या ह्यशरूपास्ते तत्तत्कार्यस्य सिद्धये॥</p>
<p>Derivations of the word Krishna—</p>
<p><strong>(१) कर्षति आत्मसात्करोति, आनन्दत्वेन परिणमयति मनो भक्तानां, इति कृष्णः।</strong></p>
<p>(२) कर्षयत्यरीन्महाप्रभावशक्त्या, इति कृष्णः।</p>
<p><strong>(३) कर्षति सर्वान् स्वकुक्षौ प्रलयकाले इति कृष्णः।</strong></p>
<p>The following stanzas relating to the name of Sri Krishna found in Krishnopanishad, Mahabharata, Brahmavaivarta Purana etc, will be interesting.</p>

<p>Sri Krishna says in Maha Bharata regarding Himself as to why He is called Krishna—</p>
<p>कृषामि मेदिनीं पार्थ भूत्वा कृष्णायसोमहान्।<br>
कृष्णो वर्णश्च मे यस्मात् तेन कृष्णोहमर्जुन॥</p>
<pre><code>                    *(शान्ति पर्व १६३-४९)*
</code></pre>
<p>It will be worth noting to find that all people including Vaishnavas, Smarthas and others at the completion of all Karmas conclude them by statingthe words <strong>सर्व श्रीकृष्णार्पणमस्तु</strong> dedicating everything to Lord Krishna</p>
<p>Lord Krishna has fascinated the largest number of people in the world and is adored not only by persons belonging to several cults of Vaishnavism but also by a large number of Saivas, Smarthas and Saktas, not to speak of persons other than those of the Hindu nation, and Sri Krishna has been highly admired as the Great Author of Srimad Bhagavad Gita and the Great Teacher of the essence of philosophies contained therein. He is the Grandmaster of Yogins He is worshipped not only by the nine methods of devotion, but also by other methods, one of them being to love Him as a &ldquo;Little Son&rdquo; i.e, by <strong>पुत्र वात्सल्यं</strong> consistently with His very First Childhood at the Beginning of the Creation as per the sloka— <strong>वटस्य पत्रस्य पुटे शयान वालं मुकुन्द मनसा स्मरामि</strong></p>
<p>The following are the 64 noble qualities of Sri Krishna mentioned in Srimad Bhagavata, something like the popular 64 Kalas or arts—</p>
<p><strong>अय नेता सुरम्यान सर्वल्लक्षणान्वित।<br>

<p>I now give the horoscope of Sri Krishna which will be interesting from the astronomical historical and other points of view</p>
<p>The birth of Lord Krishna, if it is to be called a birth at all which is not so but incarnation has taken place at the time of the following planetary conjunction as per the work of astronomy known as <strong>खमाणिक्यम्</strong> &ldquo;Kha-Manikyam&rdquo;</p>
<p>उच्चस्था शशिभौमचान्द्रिशनयो लग्नं वृषो लाभगो<br>

<p>Zodiac of Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>In this connection I also give the following <strong>एकश्लोकी भागवतम्</strong> which is so popular and which gives in a nutshell the history of Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>आदौदेवकिदेविगर्भजनन गोपीगृहे वर्धनम्<br>
मायापृतनजीवितापहरण गोवर्धनोद्धारणम्।</p>
<p>कसच्छेदन कौरवादि मयन कुन्तीसुतापालन<br>
एतद्भागवत पुराणकथित श्रीकृष्णलीलामृतम्॥</p>
<p>It is said that those devotees who are always engrossed in the thought of Sri Krishna easily get merged in Him just like sacrificial offerings in the fire as per the following stanza.</p>
<p>कृष्णे रता कृष्णमनुस्मरन्ति<br>
रात्रौ च कृष्ण पुनरुत्थिता ये।<br>
ने भिन्नदेहा प्रविशन्ति कृष्ण<br>
हविर्यथा मन्त्रहुत हुताशे॥</p>
<pre><code>      *(Krishnamritamaharnava by Madhvacharya)*
</code></pre>
<p>It istherefore said that one ought to bestow his thought on God without delay</p>
<p>कृष्ण त्वदीयपदपकजपजरान्त<br>
अद्यैव मे विशतु मानसराजहस।<br>
प्राणप्रयाणसमये कफवातपित्तै<br>
कण्ठावरोधनविधौ स्मरण कुतस्ते॥</p>
<p>One has to certainly consider the position that he may become absolutely unable to think of God at the time of his death when doctors will be pouring all sorts of uselessmixtures in the mouth and inserting needles on your body in the name of injections and doing operations on you before ever Yama or his Kinkaras think of pricking or kicking you, when your throat will get clogged by phlegm, when your brain will be in the full delirium and when you will be totally unable to speak or pay any attention to the thought of God If you have been leading a good life and secured the favour of God it is possible that you will be engrossed in the thought of God at the time of your death and obtain salvtion as stated in Bhagavad Gita, Chap 8, Slo 5</p>
<p>अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन् मुक्त्वा कलेबरम्।<br>
य प्रयाति मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशय॥</p>
<p>Note that one has to lead such yogic life so as to be able to control his mind in such a manner as to concentrate and meditate upon Him at the time of death with a view to get bliss In Gita Chap 8, Slo 9 and 10 Sri Krishna prescribes the following method to be adopted for gaining the above purpose He says—</p>
<p>प्रयाणकाले मनसाचलेन<br>
भक्त्या युक्तो योगबलेन चैव।<br>
भ्रुवोर्मध्ये प्राणमावेश्य सम्यक्<br>
स तं पर पुरुषमुपैति दिव्यम्॥</p>
<p>But where is the attempt made for this high attainment in the midst of doctors&rsquo; medicines, comprising Strychine Strophanthus, Spirits-Vini-Gallisibesides Panopepton, the most disagreeable and nautiating Gomamsa Rasa—extract of &ldquo;Prime lean,&rdquo; beef—given in the false hope of maintaining hearts action without considering the Flash of Call that stops the heart &lsquo;Tuck&rsquo; Why this unmecassary Polution of the soul? Remember that the secret of life is entirely in the hands of the invisible and not easily knowable power.</p>
<p>As regards the name of Sri Krishna Sri Sankaracharya observes as follows—</p>
<p>विना यस्य ध्यान व्रजति पशुता सूकरमुखा<br>
विना यत्य ज्ञान जनिमृतिभय याति जनता।<br>
विना यस्य स्मृया कृमिशत जनिं याति स विभु<br>
शरण्यो लोकेशो मम भवतु कृष्णोऽक्षिविषय॥</p>
<p>May that Sri Krishna, the Refuge and the Lord of Universe appear before my eyes, without meditating on whom men become equal to a beast Just as a pig and the like; without knowing whom men get into the fear of rebirths and re-deaths; and without remembering whom they get the lives of worms</p>
<p>I may add the following sloka for the readers attention—</p>
<p>एकोऽपि कृष्णस्य कृत प्रणामो दशाश्वमेधावभृथैश्व तुल्य।<br>
दशाश्वमेधी पुनरेति जन्म कृष्णप्रणामी न पुनर्भवाय॥</p>
<p>Unlike the other Avataras Sri Krishna has played such a wonderful part in the annals of History, Religion, Philosophy and Yoga that he has opened the eyes of the world as to how the God has to be worshipped Krishna is worshipped as a Child as Balakrishna He is worshipped along with cows as GopalakrishnaHe is worshipped as one playing the flute asMuraleedhar Krishna or VenugopalakrishnaHe is worshipped with conch and discus <strong>शंम्ब चक्र</strong> etc, as Maha Vishnu. He isworshipped as Yogeshvara, the Master of Yogins and as the Teacher as Gitacharya as propounder of profound knowledge of the essence of philosophy He is worshipped as a</p>
<p>charotees as Parthasarathy. (of course the Driver of the whole Universe.) He is worshipped as the holder of the Govardhana mountain on the tip of his little finger and who is also worshipped as Virat, the Controller of several globes and whose main residence is in Goloka said to be over and above Vaikuntha.</p>
<p>Think of the glory of Sri Krishna, the Mighty Ruler of the Universe and His Huge, Unlimited, Grand, Blazing Dazzling, Baffling, Terrific and yet Loving Form shown to Arjuna and others by blessing them with the specially capacitated powerful divine vision to be able to see His Whole Form in one glance, so that your veneration towards Him will advance further and further. Worship Him, the Foremost Deity and leave every thing unto His hands, by trusting Him and this is all that can be done in this world and this course itself is the greatest achievement. I may suggest to adore Him by performing His Pooja, with my Srouta Maha Pooja Vidhan provided one knows the Veda Mantras and if one requires a complete set of necessary requisites for the Pooja the same may be taken from my Pati Pooja Vidhan, 3rd edition.</p>
<p>Also perform Archanas of Sri Krishna with Krishna Ashtottara Satanama, Krishna Sahasra-</p>
<p>nama, Prachanda Krishna Sahasranama, Bhagavatheeya Krishna Sahasranama, being the thousand names of Sri Maha Vishnu inclusive of various Leelas displayed in the ten Avataras described in Srimad Bhagavata, or with the popular Bharatheeya Vishnu Sahasranama, Gopala Sahasranama or Vasudeva Sahasranama, with plenty of fresh fragrant flowers or gold and silver made flowers or real pearls or diamonds and other precious stones or with gold and silver coins and occasionally with a lakh of lotuses just as the Pooja of Siva is performed with a lakh of Bilva tri-petals according to your love, devotion and purse with a liberal mind without playing any duplicity Do not forget the holy basil, the garland of which is worn by Sri Krishna, who is therefore called <strong>तुलसीदास भूषण</strong></p>
<p><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p><em>*As regards Sri Krishna&rsquo;s birth, there are slight changes of certain planets in His horoscope and some differences are found which require scrutiny by able astronomers Some say, it was 100 years BK (before Kalı) Viz before the closing of Duapara Yuga i.c in8, 63, 900th year of the Duaparayuga that Sri Krishna made His appearance in the form of a baby and Vishnu as per the following, sloka—</em></p>

<p>God and His Sweetness.</p>
<p>In the field of devotional investigation, it is discovered that the sweetest or all the sweet things in the world is the name of God It is said to be “sweeter than sugar, sugar candy, honey, grapes etc., sweet fruits as per the popular authority—</p>
<p>मधुमधुर दधिमधुर द्राक्षामधुर सितापि मधुरैव।<br>
मधुरादपि मधुरतर मधुरानाथस्य यङ्गीतम्॥</p>
<p>Ι give the following sloka in conformity with the stanza found in Pandava Gita by addressing to the tongue— the true enjoyer of tastes</p>
<p>हे जिह्वे रससारज्ञे सर्वदा मधुरप्रिये।<br>
मधुरस्तवपीयूष पिबप्रीत्या निरन्तरम्॥</p>
<p>Not only the name of God is sweet but also His figure, His limbs and His actions are also sweet as described in the following prayeı</p>
<p>मधुर स्तोत्रम्।</p>
<p>वदन मधुर वचन मधुर नयन मधुर गमनं मधुरम्।<br>
वसन मधुर हसन मधुर मधुराधिपतेरखिल मधुरम्॥</p>
<p>His face is sweet, His speech sweet, His eyes sweet, His crawling sweet, His garment sweet, and</p>
<p>Whose smile is sweet, to such Lord of sweetness do I pray</p>
<p>चरण मधुर शरण मधुर तरण मधुर भरण मधुरम्।<br>
रमण मधुर भ्रमण मधुर मधुराधिपतेरखिल मधुरम्॥</p>
<p>His feet sweet, He is our sweet Refuge, who provides us with sweet means for crossing the ocean of the bitter Samsara, Whose protection is sweet, Whose plays sweet and Whose rambles are sweet, to such sweet God— do I pray</p>
<p>गान मधुर तान मधुर ^(१)पानमधुर दान मधुरम्।<br>
स्थान मधुर यानं मधुर मधुराधिपतेरखिल मधुरम्॥</p>
<p>His singing sweet, His melody sweet, His drinking sweet, and His giving wealth and prosperity is sweet His residence in Goloka is sweet, and vehicle sweet and everything of Whose is sweet, to Him— do I pray</p>
<p>नृत्य मधुर कृत्य मधुर चित्त मधुर वृत्त मधुरम्।<br>
तिलैकं मधुरं चुबुक मधुर मधुराधिपतेरखिल मधुरम्॥</p>
<p>I pray to Him whose dance is sweet, doings sweet, His will sweet, deeds sweet and His musk mark on the forehead sweet and Whose chin is sweet (with the diamond ornament)</p>
<p>पाणी मधुरौ पादौ मधुरौ ^(२)वेणुर्मधुरो रेणुर्मधुर।<br>
माला मधुरा लीला मधुरा मधुराधिपतेरखिल मधुरम्॥</p>
<p>I also pray to Him whose hands are sweet, leg sweet, His playing melodius music on the flute Is So sweet, Whose foot dust also sweet, Whose Vaijayanti and flower garland and gem necklaces sweet and Whose illusory movements (Leelas) are sweet</p>
<p>Thus if one posesses a good command over senses,he may be quite satisfied with the sweet prayer given by me without hankering much after Jalebi, Jangri, Gulabjam, Ladu etc, eatables, which if excessively taken will ultimately produce the much harmful sugar, in your body (diabetes) and you will be subjected to its concomitant carbuncles and will have recourse to insoline injections and operations</p>
<p>On account of His melodius music played by Venu or Muralı He is addressed as Murali Gana Vinoda and by which He attracted the attention of not only the Rishis and Munis but also the cows</p>

<p>Hence He is worshipped with the name—</p>

<p>Thus He is called Nritya-Raja just like Sri Nataraja.</p>

<p>** **I have narrated the subject of devotion to God from the standard stand-point of His being the Holder of Tremendous All-round Powers, the Terrible Commander-General, the Most Revered,</p>
<p>the Greatest of the Great, the Cause of Creation and our Existence, and the Blesser of all blisses I have therefore not dealt with the popular aspect of His Childish <strong>play</strong>, the youthful <strong>gay</strong>, even with cowherd&rsquo;s <strong>hay,</strong> stealing butter in the <strong>day</strong> and drinking milk and <strong>whey</strong> and saying <strong>nay</strong>, keeping every one at <strong>bay,</strong> come whoever <strong>may,</strong> crushing every demon in the <strong>way,</strong> though they stand in <strong>array,</strong> regardless of <strong>fray</strong>; yet hiding in the house of Nanda with han <strong>grey,</strong> discarding the defrauding priests requiring <strong>pay,</strong> and the selfish Vaishnavas shouting <strong>Jay, Jay</strong> and <strong>Jay</strong> for the sake of Prasadams <strong>tray</strong> and to which they have fallen a <strong>prey,</strong> without caring to sincerely pray. Remember His excellent <strong>play,</strong> while eating <strong>clay</strong>, making the universe <strong>display</strong> (in His tiny mouth) to His mother&rsquo;s utmost <strong>dismay.</strong> Worship Him straight <strong>away</strong> in any form you <strong>may</strong> without causing <strong>delay.</strong></p>
<p>See the announcement of the salvation army boldly advertised in placards &ldquo;I am not ashamed&rsquo; to obtain salvation at the hands of God etc. This christian idea may be adopted even by Krishnian friends, and worked out by means of a journal for the uplift of the Hindu or Sanatanadharma.</p>
<p>No non-sense of sexual enjoyments attributed to Krishna in his boyhood of the age of about 12 by any ill disposed persons need be considered.</p>
<p>The following is the Marathi poem correspond ing to the Sanskrit stanza given above in the page 108 may be useful for those interested in- Marathi—</p>
<p>कृष्णा तुझा हढपदावुज पिजराहो<br>
आताचित्यात मम मानस हस राहो।<br>
अर्ती त्रिदोष जरि दाटति कठि जेव्हा<br>
कै चे (से) तुझ स्मरण होइल नाथतेव्हा॥</p>
<p>As regards the esoteric and allegorical meanings of the word Krishna, His weapons and His Mantras etc, I refer to my book Gopalatapaniand Krishnopanishads in English The Vedic Krishna Gayatri may be found in the Upanishads and as regards other Pauranic Krishna Gayatıis, they may be referred to Mantra Maharnava etc</p>
<p>I conclude the subject of Sri Krishna by giving the following &lsquo;Krishna Darsana Mahatmya&rdquo; which applies only, if you secure the Darsana or Pranama of thc Original Krishna, but not at the hands of money extracting, misleading and Prasad greedy priests, Acharyas or Vaishnavas respectively that keep on idols with</p>
<p>the ulterior object of maintaining themselves and who waste the monies of God in enjoying sexual pleasures by making the idol a scape-goat to suit their selfish purposes and beastly desires</p>
<p>The greatness of the Great God is such that even imitation Vaishnavas, the dodging Priests and the false Acharyas derive numerous advantages in the mere name of God with all their hypocritical ways</p>

<p>श्रीराम।</p>
<p>A few words regarding the All-pervading, All-merciful and All mighty God who is also worshipped with the name and in the form of Rama, will be of much interest to Rama-Bhaktas, and I therefore deal with the subject with reference to the word, the history and the period of Rama</p>
<p>The name Rama has become popular on account of His All pleasing, All-moving, and All-existing nature possessed by Him, as per derivations given below—</p>
<p>(1) रमयतीति राम। (रमु क्रीडायाम्।)<br>
(2) लोकान् रञ्जयतीति राम।<br>
(3) रम्यतेऽस्मिन् सदा सर्वे गुणरूपवशीकृतै— इति राम!<br>
(4) रामो रमयता श्रेष्ठ (रामायण ५३ -९) अयोध्याकाण्ड</p>
<p>The following are the definitions of the word Rama—</p>
<p>(1) रमन्ते योगिनोऽनन्ते सत्यानन्दे<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> चिदात्मनि।<br>
इति रामपदेना सौ पर ब्रह्माभिधीयते॥</p>
<p>**                    ** <em>(Ramarahasyopanishad.)</em></p>
<p>(2) राशब्दस्तत्पदार्थ स्यात् मकारस्त्वपदार्थक<br>
तयोस्सयोजनमसि तत्वं तत्वविदो विदु॥</p>
<p>(3) रा शब्दो विश्व वचन मश्चापीश्वरवाचकः।<br>
विश्वेषा ईश्वरो योहि तेन राम प्रकीर्त्तित॥</p>
<p><strong>(4) यस्मिन् रमन्ते मुनयो विद्यया ज्ञानविप्लवे।<br>
तं गुरुं प्राह रामेति रमणात् राम इत्यपि॥</strong></p>
<p>Sri Rama, besides being called Rama, is called Abhirama, Lokabhirama, Pattabhirama, Vijayabhirama, Syamabhirama, Paramabhi Rama, Leelabhirama, Vachabhirama, Virama etc, in addition to His having taken three incarnations of Rama, Balarama and Parasurama Rama is the 396th name of the Vishnu Sahasranama.</p>
<p>The excellence of the word Rama is described hereunder—</p>
<p>रामनाम्न पर किञ्चित् तत्व वेदे मृतावपि।<br>
सहितासु पुराणेषु नैव तन्त्रेषु विद्यते॥</p>
<p>There is no name greater than Rama. It is cream of the Vedas, Smritis, Samhitas, Puranas etc. The value of the word Rama is further stated as follows—</p>
<p>नाम्ना सहस्र दिव्याना स्मरणे यत्फल लभेत्।<br>
तत्फल लभते मर्त्य रामोच्चारणमात्रत॥</p>
<p>Accordingly Siva has said while addressing Paivati—</p>
<p>श्रीराम राम रामेति रमे रामे मनोरमे।<br>
सहस्रनामभिस्तुल्यं रामनाम वरानने॥</p>
<p>A single utterance of the name Rama is equal to reciting all the thousand names of the Sahasranaina While Siva asked Parvati to come for dinner, she replied that she would come after finishing the Parayana of Sahasranama when Sıva told her to take Rama Nama stating it is equal to Sahasranama and so she did</p>
<p>The holy name of Rama when connected with the physiological movement of the mouth of men operates in the following manner</p>
<p>राशब्दोच्चारणादेव मुखान्निर्यान्ति पातका।<br>
पुनः प्रवेशभीत्या तु मकारस्तु कवाटवत्॥</p>
<p>Thus when the word &ldquo;Ra&rdquo; is pronounced by opening the mouth the sins are expelled, and for fear of the possibility of their re-entry the syllable &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; formed by the closing of the lips serves the purpose of a door</p>
<p>Not only this, but also when the name Rama is fixed on to the tongue— the gate— it serves the purpose of Gem Light, throwing light outside the mouth on one side and inside the throat on the other and thus removes the outwardly worldly infatuations and the inwardly ignorance as stated below—</p>
<p>राम नाम मणि दीपधर, जीह देहरी द्वार।<br>
तुलसी भीतर बाहिरो, जो चाहत उजियार॥</p>
<p>Not only does the word Rama serve the purpose of a door to prevent sins and the purpose of the light of knowledge as stated above, but the word Ramarama has the efficacy of causing fright to Yama and the flight of his followers and the release of a person from his miserable plight. Hence it is only right in this world of fight to utter the word Rama with all your might fixing tight your mind&rsquo;s sight on Him raising your soul to its fullest height which requires no freight but only slight spiritual light</p>
<p>भर्जन भवबीजाना आर्जन सुख सपदाम्।<br>
तर्जन यमदूताना राम रामेति गर्जनम्॥</p>
<p>Note that the leonine roar of the word Rainaparches up the seeds of worldly bondage <strong>संसार</strong> It secures for us happiness and wealth and scares away the messengers of Yama</p>
<p>I now give the following interesting stanza which will be striking when we examine the meaning underlying therein</p>
<p><strong>नायणाय यदृतेक्षराष्टक यद्विहाय नशिवायपञ्चकम्।<br>
यद्युतं भवति मुक्तिद् द्वयंतद्द्द्वयं हृदि विभावयेऽद्वयम्॥</strong></p>
<p>It will be seen that the holy eight-lettered Mantra of the Ashtakshari <strong>ओं नमो नारायणाय</strong> is not potent without the vital syllable <strong>रा</strong> as it will become <strong>नारायण</strong>and conseqently not capable of conferring Mukti (Ayana) Likewise the holy five lettered PanchakshariMantra <strong>नमश्शिवाय</strong>useless without the vital syllable <strong>म</strong> as it will become <strong>नशिवाय</strong> and therefore not capable of producing the desired result besides losing its auspiciousness <strong>(शिवं=मङ्गलं)</strong> Thus both the important Vaishnava and Saiva Mantras become fruitless without the letters <strong>रा</strong> &amp; <strong>म</strong> being the living principles of both the Mantras.</p>
<p>In this age of Kali there is no higher Dharma or Duty laid down than to pronounce the word Rama which is the remover of all sins of mankind Hence with great reverence one should always utter the word Rama with its two letters and obtain salvation as stated below</p>
<p>रामेति वर्णद्वयमादरेण सदा जपन् मुक्तिमुपैति जतु।<br>
कलौ युगे कल्मषमानसाना अन्यत्र धर्मे खलु नाधिकार॥</p>
<p>Tulasidas says—</p>
<p>राम नामको कल्पतरु कलिकल्याण निवास॥</p>
<p>Further the sweetness of the word Rama is proclaimed as follows—</p>
<p>अक्षर (आखर) मधुरमनोहर दोऊ।<br>
वर्ण विलोचन जन जिय जोऊ॥</p>
<p>सुमिरत सुलभ सुखद सब काहू।<br>
लोकलाहु परलोक निबाहु॥</p>
<p>Meaning, both the letters <strong>रा</strong> &amp; <strong>म</strong> of the name Rama are sweet and they are like two eyes of devotecs and in expressing by mouth they are so simple and yet givers of happiness both in this world and the world to come.</p>
<p>Apart from what has been stated above regarding the value of the word Rama, it is such that even if one twists the same topsy-turvy and expresses it wrongly he gets all advantages and benefit as per the following instance.</p>
<p>Valmeeki informed Sri Rama that he was formerly a hunter and on an occasion when he came across Sapta Rishis, he wanted to kill them but the Rishis requested him to ascertain whether his family members for whose support he was accumulating sins were prepared to share in his sins He asked them and got a negative answer On his narrating this to Sapta Rishis they advised and initiated him to make prayer with Rama Nama, but Valmeeki forgot the correct</p>
<p>pronounciation and began uttering <strong>मरा, मरा</strong>, in the place of **राम, राम,**but all the samehe secured the best result and subsequently became the great author of Sri Ramayana (Vide Ananda Ramayana)</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>From Valmeeki&rsquo;s example itwill be noteworthy to observe as to how the man undertakes the work of committing sin after sin for the sake of his family with the result that the very same family members though they take advantage of his misdeeds ultimately disapprove of his actions and decline to have any share in the sins committed by himas pointed out to ValmeekiThus is the ideal foolishness attached to almost every man&rsquo;s mentality under the strongest influence of Maya or illusion or infatuation or to really speak the utter inborn and ingrained foolishness concerning the naturally weak brain of man, to which an intelligent man ought not to succumb</p>
<p>Remember that a son is as sweet as a bun,<br>
But Lo while observing in the long run,<br>
You find him making all your fun<br>
Putting before you his youthful gun,<br>
He drives you only to go to vun (forest)<br>
Hence in your last days there will be none,<br>
But God alone comes to your rescue when,<br>
Hence dissociate yourself before you are gone<br>
Note how sweet is son when he is born,<br>
But when he gets his mischievous horn (attains majority)</p>
<p>कूजन्त रामरामेति मधुर मधुराक्षरम्।<br>
आरुह्यकविता शाखा वन्दे वाल्मीकि कोकिलम्॥</p>
<p>I salute Valmeeki— Cuckoo who sweetly sings the sweet words of Rama-Rama, sitting on the branches of the tree of poetry</p>
<p>The further extrardinary effect of even an unconscious utterance of the word Rama is set out in the following stanza</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>He becomes indeed a great thorn<br>
Even without caring for your corn,<br>
And you are entirely forlorn,<br>
Leaving you to mourn of him every morn,<br>
Hence do not teel adorned<br>
By the unforeseen foe born,<br>
So also is the dame if damnable wife,<br>
With all her sweet enchanting words like fife,<br>
Will only serve the purpose of a golden knife,<br>
But she is a voluntarily procured burden of life</strong></p>
<p><strong>It behoves therefore to attach yourself to Sri Rama by<br>
giving up your infatuation for your wife, son and others</strong></p>
<pre><code>    (LG)
</code></pre>
<p>It is surprising that the belly filling infatuated Brahmins offer their blessings to the infatuated persons to sufier in the midst of infatuation with the wordings <strong>त्रिपीडास्तु दिने दिने</strong> viz, may the three sufferings be daily attending on you— worries due to wife, son and beggars</p>
<p>वनेच रामो वसुधाच राम नदीस्तरामो न भय स्मराम।<br>
इतीरयन्तो विपिने किराता मुक्ति गता रामपदानुषङ्गात्॥</p>
<p>We roam in the forest and wander over the land We swim across the rivers and we think notof fear Thus saying in the forest, the hunters attained salvation by reason of unconsciously expressing the word Rama contained in other ordinary words used viz, <strong>चराम, तराम &amp; स्मराम</strong> though being ignorant of the word Rama and the value thereof.</p>
<p>Rama Nama may be uttered whether with devotion or indifference of jealousy or laziness as in any case it gives you all auspicious results as stated in Tulasidas Ramayana as under—</p>
<p>भाव कुभाव अनस्वआलसहू।<br>
नाम जपत मंगल दिशि दशहू॥</p>
<p>It is said that while Siva drank the deadly poison uttered the name of Rama which produced the result of nectar as, referred to in 8th— Skandha of Bhagavata</p>
<p><strong>रामेति रामभद्रेति रामचंद्रेतिवा स्मरन्।<br>
नरो नलिप्यते पापै भुक्ति मुक्ति च विन्दति॥</strong></p>
<p>It is observed in the Shastras—</p>
<p>मानस वाचिक पाप कर्मणा समुपार्जितम्।<br>
श्रीरामस्मरणेनैव व्यपोहति न संशय॥</p>
<p>Meaning, sins acquired by thought, word, and deed, undoubtedly vanish away by the mere thought of the word Rama</p>
<p>The following popular song advocates Rama Bhajana by pointing out the utility of mouth mainly intended for Rama Bhajana and not for merely eating, drinking and placing yourself on a par with any animal</p>
<p>राम भजन कोदिया- कमल मुख हरि भजन कोदिया।<br>
स्यावा पीया सुख से सोया नाहकजमाना स्वोया॥</p>

<p>Look at the Telugu dance in praise of Rama (శ్రీనామమెంరుచిరా ! ఒరామ నీ నామమె రుచిరా) pointing out the taste contained in the word Rama</p>
<p><strong>The Glory of Rama</strong></p>
<p>The name Rama is one which has converted a large number of devotees into great souls, particularly in the Mahratta Country, where the great Bhakta Tukaram is said to have gone to</p>
<p>Vaikuntha directly with his physical body (See the pictures that are available of his Vaikuntha Gamana) We have two great Ramadasas one belonging to Bhadrachalam in the Nizam&rsquo;s Dominions, the other to the Mahratta Country, besides the great Tulasidas whose splendid literary production of Ramayana in pure Hindi language is highly admired by a large section of learned men and translated even in English, German and French languages by European authors Moreover the Ramayana of Valmeeki has been written in English by Mr Griffith</p>
<p>The name of Rama has attracted even Mohammedans, and Kabirdas is one that took into his heart the attachment for Rama in a manner that his devotion was admired not only by the public at large, but also God Rama was pleased with him and conferred bliss on him For the sake of being initiated in the Rama Taraka Mantra, kings have sacrificed their kingdoms like Tanisha Badsha, though a born Mohammedan The following stanza indicates the high order of Ramabhakti</p>
<p>मज्जीव मदनुग्रह मदधिप मद्भावन मत्सुस्व<br>
मत्तात मम सद्गुरुं मम वर मोहान्ध्यविच्छेदनम्।</p>
<p><strong>मत्पुण्यं मदनैकबाधवजनं मज्जीवनं मन्निधि<br>
मत्सिद्धिं मम सर्वकर्म सुकृत राम भजे तारकम्॥</strong></p>
<p>We all know the worldwide popularity of the word Rama whose name is written from thecommencement of the birth on the top of the horoscopes with the wording &ldquo;Sri Ramajayam&rdquo; and the name Rama is carried throughout the life nay, even after death while the body is carried on the bier, among the largest number of peopleThe devotees of Rama have spread all over India and</p>
<p>even Thibet</p>
<p>The word Rama is treated as an effective medicine for several purposes as mentioned below—</p>
<p>व्यामोहप्रशमौषध मुनिमनोवृत्तिप्रवृत्यौषध<br>
दैत्योन्मूलकरौषध भवभयप्रध्वसनैकौषधम्।<br>
भक्तानन्दकरौषध त्रिभुवने सजीवनैकौषध<br>
श्रेय प्राप्तिकरौषध पिब मन श्रीरामनामौषधम्॥</p>
<p>The word Rama is the Hindu national name of God which when made to ring in the ears and around the physical body has the peculiar magnetic effect of purifying the mind besides stimulating the mental body and the astral body even after the</p>
<p>physical body of a man becomes dead body so as to enable the post martem lite with its Linga body to shake off the Kamalaukic troubles and Yamayathana tortures and have an easy access to. Vaikuntha through the Parshadas or the messengers of God Maha Vishnu without any more rotting for rebirths in any kind of womb of any life Therefore the name of Rama may be used at the time of death because of the absence of conditions required for using the Pranava Mantra (Om) with its full knowledge and which Mantra ought to be chanted and meditated upon before leaving the physical body by any man of intelligence if he cares to possess the key note of obtaining salvation as stated by the Great Guru Sri Krishna in Bhagavad Gita (Chap 8 Slo 13)</p>
<p>ओमित्येकाक्षर ब्रह्म व्याहरन् मामनुस्मरन्।<br>
य प्रयाति त्यजन्देह स याति परमा गतिम्॥</p>
<p>The intimateconnection of Pranava with Ramataraka Mantra is said as follows—</p>
<p>ओतप्रोतसमस्तवस्तुनिचय ओंकारबीजाक्षर</p>
<p>ओंकारप्रकृति षडक्षरहित ओंकारकन्दाकुरम्।</p>
<p>ओंकारस्फुटभूर्भुवस्सवरित ओघत्रयाराधित<br>
ओंकारोज्ज्वलसिहपीठनिलय राम भजे तारकम्॥</p>
<p>I may add that Sri Rama has also been described in the form of Virat in Adhyatma Ramayana, corresponding to Krishna in Bhagavata and other Puranas Sri Krishna is possessed of 16 Kalas while Rama&rsquo;s incaination comprise of 12 Kalas or fragments</p>
<p>Rama Mantras</p>
<p>I give the following Rama Taraka Mantra for the benefit of readers which is originally <strong>रा रामाय स्वाहा</strong> the Vedic Mantra, but the Pauranic Mantra is<strong>रा रामाय नम</strong> sometimes with the addition of the name Janaki also in a particular form</p>
<p>Dealing however from Sri Rama&rsquo;s Charama sloka&rsquo;s point of view, having regard to Sri Rama Saranam, I hereunder give the Rama Ashtakshari Mantra <strong>श्रीराम शरणं मम</strong>, based on the following authority as found in Rama Rahasyopanishad</p>
<p><strong>कि मत्रै र्बहुभिर्विनश्वरफलैरायाससाध्यैर्वृथा<br>
कि तैर्लोभवितानमात्रविफलैस्ससारदुःखावहै।<br>
एकस्सन्नपि सर्वमत्रफलदो लोभादिभिःप्रोज्झित<br>
श्रीरामश्शरण ममेति सतत मत्रोऽयमष्टाक्षर॥</strong></p>
<p>In Skhanda Purana, Valmeeki Ramayana Mahatmyam, the very first stanza also deals with seeking shelter under Rama, without which there is no other refuge in this world</p>
<p>श्रीरामश्शरणं समस्तजगता राम विना का गति<br>
रामेण प्रतिहन्यते कलिमल रामाय कार्यनम्।<br>
रामान्नश्यति कालभीमभुजगो रामस्य सर्व वशे<br>
रामभक्तिरखण्डिता भवतुमे रामत्वमेवाश्रय॥</p>
<p>Tulasidas confirms the above and states in his double barrelled language applicable to both Sanskrit and Hindi as follows—</p>
<p>जय राम रमा रमण शमन भवताप भयाकुल पाहि जनम्।<br>
अवधेश सुरेश रमेश विभो शरणागत मॉगत पाहि प्रभो॥</p>
<p>We have a number of Rama Mantras used for various purposes, from one single letter up to 30-lettered Mantras, many of them are found in Upanishads and Puranas.</p>
<p>Hail to the Rama Mantra as follows—</p>
<p><strong>जयतु जयतु मन्त्रो जन्म साफल्य मन्त्र<br>
प्रणव निलय मन्त्रो प्राणनिर्याण मन्त्र।<br>
प्रकृति पुरुष मन्त्रो मुक्तिमार्गैकमन्त्र<br>
सकलनिगम मन्त्रो राम रामेति मन्त्र॥</strong></p>
<p>I think I ought to give the Veda Mantra of Sri Rama found in the Rig Veda also—</p>
<p>भ॒द्रो भ॒द्रया॒ सच॑मान॒ आगा॒त् स्वसा॑र जा॒रो अ॒भ्येति॑ पश्चा॒त्।</p>

<p><strong>Rama&rsquo;s Reign and History</strong></p>
<p>Rama is not only the incarnation of God, but also the incarnation of Dharma of the Highest Order of Morality and the Ideal Ruler of the best administration</p>
<p>It is a great pity that most of the educated men are guided by western historians that have infused the knowledge of History of India in a sceptic manner without knowing the special features of the History of this Bharata Land Unable to trace the History of Rama, which can be proved beyond all doubt as being of the age of a minimum of about 90000/- to a lakh of years ago, they have been harping on their period of a few years B C</p>
<p>A reference to the planetary conjunctions at the time of Rama&rsquo;s birth and His rule if cal- culated properly by means of astronomical and astrological survey, will give at least about a</p>
<p>100 thousand years but not a few years before christianity While certain implements and instru ments exhibited in museums out of archeological interest admittedly prove their existence of over 10,000 years and this evidence is sufficient to establish the existence of a civilization earlier than the period of 10000 and more years ago; where is the difficulty in recognising a still older cıvılızation prevailing at the reign of Rama when it is based upon accurate scientific calculations of astronomy? And as such the educated Indians need not be confounded by the confusion created by misleading historians calling as mythology, to such history of Rama with its admirable, ancient civilization of the highest order with all the noble principles of mankind which cannot even be easily imitated today in spite of abundant education with a number of universities</p>
<p>The European authors that are unable to guage the voluminous quantum of Vedas and the number of Sakhas but are only guided by their restricted knowledge of the available portion of the Rig Veda now in print, and those depending on Rajatarangini, the History of Kashmire and some references in Raghuvamsa by Kalidasa are not sufficiently competent to establish precisely</p>
<p>the period of Rama&rsquo;s date It is certain that they do admit as to the life and adventures of Rama and they further admit that the &ldquo;Greeks did not acquire any intimate knowledge of India,&rdquo; That being so it is no use their approximately fixing any period they like, whether 13th or 14th century BC The minimum period of 20 years for each reign of kings and fixing 1182 B C as the period of the rule of Damodara, the II, one of the kings of Kashmire, and so also fixing the period of Rama to Sumitra is not a proper thing While Queen Victoria&rsquo;s reign has covered more than a period of 60 years and witnessed the celebration of her Diamond Jubilee, the imaginary average of 20 years of giving for each reign to the ancient kings of India cannot be depended upon Thus fixing even 16th century BC is not the correct method to arrive at a conclusion regarding this most ancient epic Ramayana. It is known to all that Sri Krishna who took His incarnation long after Rama was born about the end of Dwapara. The latest date assigned to Krishna&rsquo;s birth according to ancient authorites viz, the one given in the astrononical work known as Kha-Manikya is 647 A K.</p>
<p>Further the Kuru Pandavas period is definitely</p>
<p>known as 653 years after Kali Yuga as in Raj Tarangini</p>
<p>शतेषु षट्सुसार्धेषुत्र्यधिकेषु च भूतले।<br>
कलेर्गतेषुवर्षाणामभवन् कुरुपाण्डवा॥</p>
<p>From all the calendars we find that to-day is 5035th year from the beginning of Kali Yuga This being so and references to Ramayana being found in Maha Bharata, how can we take 13th century B.C. as the probable time of Ramayana as suggested by Western or westernized critics?</p>
<p>Mr Griffith also concurs with me and says regarding the birth of Rama &ldquo;I leave to astronomersto examine whether the parts of the description agred with one another, and if this be the case thence to deduce the date&rdquo;</p>
<p>One has to bear in mind the destruction of a large number of books from time to time, at the several conquests of India and the heavy loss of knowledge caused by the destruction of several Sakhas of the Vedas, and the works on astronomy and astrology, engineeling and Dhanurveda the ancient military science, combined with the applications of Archery, Sastras and Astias and the varieties of electric airships (Vimanas) of several descriptions with automatic arrangements and a good</p>
<p>lot of literature on various subjects, and how we are handicapped without getting much information regarding history and science But all the same as stated by me, if the movements of planets with their natural rotations on the scientific basis of astronomy are taken into account, we must necessarily come to a definite conclusion as to the period of Rama&rsquo;s Life References by Rishis made in Vedas and Puranas as the Drashtas or the Seers of Mantras should not be confounded with the mention made in them earlier or later in view of the fact and admissions found even by the European authors as to the saint&rsquo;s eyes piercing through the past, present and future, who are therefore called Trikala Jnani</p>
<p>It will be found from the genealogy of Rama that he is the 40th descendant from Brahma, 36th from Soorya and 34th from Ikshvakhu</p>
<p>Ikshvakhu&rsquo;s sons from days of old<br>
Were ever brave and mighty-souled,<br>
Their holy works have won them praise<br>
Through countless years from Manu&rsquo;s days</p>
<p>Note that the 35th ancestor of Rama was (Vaivasvatha) Manu.</p>
<p>वैवस्वतोमनु नार्म माननीय मनीषिणाम्॥</p>
<p>We know that (Svayambhuva) Manu is the famous law giver and whose laws are respected even today</p>
<p>The following is the horoscope of Sri Rama which may be interesting to calculate in fixing the period of His birth or incarnation</p>
<p>As is well known he was born in the year Vilambi <strong>(विलबि),</strong> in the star of Punarvasu, Soola Yoga, Kaulavakarana, Monday, Abhijit Muhurta on the noon of the 9th day of Chaitra Sukla fortnight (corresponding to the latter half of March and the former half of April) which is called Rama Navamı. Vide the following extract from Bhoja Champu—</p>
<p>उच्चस्थेग्रहपञ्चके सुरगुरौ सेन्दौ नवम्या तिथौ<br>
लग्ने कर्कटके पुनर्वसुयुते मेष गते पूषणि।<br>
निर्दग्धु सकला पलाशसमिधो मेध्यादयोध्यारणे<br>
आविर्भृतमभृतपूर्वविभव यत्किञ्चिदेक महः॥</p>
<p>It was Chaitra&rsquo;s ninth returning day,<br>
The moon within that mansion shone<br>
Which Aditi looked kindly on<br>
Raised to their aper in the sky,<br>
Five brilliant planets beamed on high,<br>
Shone with the moon, in Cancer&rsquo;s sign,<br>
Jupiter with light divine<br>
Kausalya bore an infant blest<br>
With heavenly marks of grace impressed</p>
<p>Rama was born when five planets were in ascendency with their fullest power and in the Lagna of the</p>
<p>sign Cancer <strong>(कटक)</strong>, in which there were two planets the Jupiter <strong>(गुरु)</strong> and the Moon <strong>(चन्द्र)</strong> In the 4th house Libra <strong>(तुला)</strong> is the Saturn <strong>(शनि)</strong> In the 6th house Sagittarius <strong>(धनुस्)</strong> is the Descending Node <strong>(केतु)</strong> In the 7th house Capricorn <strong>(मकर)</strong> is Mars <strong>(कुज)</strong> In the 9th house Pisces <strong>(मीन)</strong> is Venus <strong>(शुक्र)</strong> In the 10th house the sign Aries <strong>(मेष)</strong> is the Sun <strong>(सूर्य)</strong>, and in the 12th house the sign Gemini <strong>(मिथुन)</strong> are Mercury <strong>(वुध)</strong> and the Ascending Node <strong>(राहु)</strong></p>
<p>** **When we have got the other details on record such as the performance of Sri Rama&rsquo;s Upanayara which took place in the year Parabhava <strong>(पराभव)</strong> Chaitra Sukla Panchami and His marriage was performed on <strong>मार्ग शीर्ष शुक्ल पञ्चमि</strong> with that lady of ladies, and the queen of queens, the fire-like Pativratha— the Great, Sita who was not born viviparous, but came out from the Earth following authority—</p>
<p>अथ मे कृषत क्षेत्र लाङ्गलादुत्थिता तत।<br>
क्षेत्र शोपयता लब्धा नाम्नो सीतेति विश्रुता॥</p>
<p>and who was given the name Sita as per the following derivation—</p>
<p><strong>सीतामुखे समुत्पन्ना बालभावेन सुन्दरी ।<br>
सीतामुखोद्भवात्सीता इत्यस्यै नाम चाकरोत्॥</strong></p>
<p>why should there be any apprehension of mythology in the face of such vivid historical and biographical evidence?</p>
<p>Further Rama is said to have incarnated in Treta Yuga as the 7th incarnation of Vishnu. In regard to calculation of Yugas some give very long periods, by taking into account Svetavaraha Kalpa, Vaivasvatamanvantara, etc It is observed by some of the authors that Rama was born on the 1st day of the 51st year of Brahma&rsquo;s life, is, the 2nd half of Brahma&rsquo;s life i.e,<strong>परार्ध</strong>which takes us to many many years ago</p>
<p>This statement is confirmed by Sri Krishna while addressing Radha as followsas referred to in Brahma Vaivartha Purana—</p>
<p>महस्रकृत्वोरामोपि भविता ब्रह्मणे दिने॥</p>
<p>Ruins of the ancient capital of Rama can still be traced near Oudh and Fizabad and the relics of his deeds in several parts of India</p>
<p>The European author&rsquo;s remarks against the highest devoted, faithful and highly cultured and most intelligent Hanuman and his comrades as barbarians are extremely uncharitable and deserve condemnation especially in view of their Darvinian admission as to their heredity</p>
<p>Look at the notes given below being an extract from the Diary of Rama which will clearly bring out the biographical aspect of Ramayana without alluding to mythology. I do not give the English months as I think it is unnecessary but only the Hindu months</p>
<p>Rama&rsquo;s Diary.</p>
<p>In the 15th year Rama went to Mithilapuri and stayed one fortnignt In the month of <strong>मार्ग शार्ष शुक्ल पञ्चमि</strong> marriage was performed For 12 years lived happily with Sita in the capital Ayodhya</p>

<p>On that day his coronation was celebrated and he took his seat on his throne, the installation</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>*The renowned Rama-Ravana war of Ramayana commenced on the 12th bright fortnight of Phalguna and ended on the 14th of the dark fortnight of Chaitra, thus occupying a period of 1 month and 18 days Valmeeki could not quote any example to this war and therefore he describes the same in the following manner—</p>
<p>ceremonies having been performed by His Lordship the Archbishop Vasishtha accompanied by the chaplains that stood in array. When they came to Ayodhya, Rama&rsquo;s age was 41 and Sita&rsquo;s age 32. On the 9th day of Bhadrapada Sita conceived. On Chaitra Sukla 12th Sita was sent of away to Valmeeki Ashrama with Lakshmana. On the 9th day of Ashadha the twins Kusa and Lava were born to Sita.</p>

<p>Rama&rsquo;s Speech.</p>
<p>His most Gracious, Highest Majestic, Imperial Celestial, and Holiest Holiness, Sri Rama has delivered several speeches before the selected audience the most important subjects such as morality, devotion and philosophy required for mankind His Rama Gita is one of the subjects of philosophy expounded by Him.</p>
<p>His speech was always sweet, short and sparing and actually meant for actions unlike the vain, lengthy, useless and impractical and sometimes misleading speeches of the inexperienced political leaders</p>
<p>The following is an extract from one of the speeches delivered by Sri Rama with his godly attitude of offeing protection to those that devotedly and submissively and sincerley surrender unto Him</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Rama&rsquo;s rising doubt was stilled,<br>
And friendly thoughts his bosom filled<br>
Thus deep in Scripture&rsquo;s lore, he spake,<br>
The suppliant will I ne&rsquo;er forsake,<br>
Nor my protecting and refuse,<br>
When one in name of friendship sues<br>
Though faults and folly blot his fame,<br>
Pity and help he still may claim<br>
Ever to and and welcome those,</p>
<p>Who pray for shelter, friends or foes<br>
No, yield him, be he proud or meek,<br>
The shelter which he comes to seek,<br>
And save thy foeman, if the deed,<br>
Should cost thy life in desperate need<br>
And shall I hear the wretched cry<br>
And my protecting aid deny&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rama&rsquo;s Happy Rule.</p>
<p>Rama&rsquo;s great qualities are so praiseworthy that they were really godly, morally manly, truly gentlemanly, sincerely friendly, generously stately and nobly kindly His patience was so marvellously cool that he would have to invite anger to enter in him for killing the wicked demoniac persons and Rakshasas His management of affairs was mostly personal and met with quick disposals without putting the people to engage lawyers and submit long memorials to be thrown away into waste paper baskets People never had to rach their brains for finding properties to be set apart for the sake of payment of taxes by foregoing their comforts and conveniences by sacrificing a decent portion of their income and for any auspicious functions to be celebrated in their houses they had not to borrow monies paying heavy interest for the same, in consequence thereof No troubles from the Corporations or Municipalities or Local Boards</p>
<p>Rama&rsquo;s supervision was so acute that all matters were disposed of immediately without making anybody to wait, wait and wait till dooms day His treatment to people was extremely considerate and full of mercy and sympathy without relegating kindness to animals and not to men as the organisation of the SPCA of to day without any society for the prevention of cruel treatment to men in the midst of a large number of selfish men</p>
<p>Owing to His Dharmic conduct and truthful character everything was found in plenty, regular umely rain, water sources full, bumper crops; labour and manure cheap, and agriculture in abundance, milk plentiful, no forest troubles, and everything was found strictly in accordance with the Shastra</p>
<p>भूमय सर्वसस्याढ्या पर्जन्या कालवर्षिण।<br>
गावोऽपि दुग्धसपन्नापादपा फलशालिन॥ (म-नि-तन्त्र)</p>
<p>The gold was so cheap that the currency coin was worth about 300/- rupees Sri Rama possessed the store of Dharma, stock of morality, treasure of knowledge, repository of truth, office of justice and he was the sacrificer of his own</p>
<p>personal comforts But for his high moral principles and kindness towards subjects and the sincere welfare of the people in his heart he would not mhave ruled for such a long period as 11,000 years maintaining utmost peace and highest order</p>
<p>The golden age of Rama&rsquo;s rule was such that men though subjected to death, they were in a position to travel to the higher worlds and heavenly abodes through the means of the then existing airships and come back to this world and also have communications with people living in planets, for which now western astronomers are tiying with Moon and Mars</p>
<p>देवायतनगा मर्त्या देवकल्पा दृढव्रता।<br>
सत्यधर्मपरा सर्वे साधव सत्यवादिन॥( महानिर्वाणतन्त्र)</p>
<p>Further,</p>
<p>लोष्टवत् परवित्तेषु पश्यन्तो मानवास्तदा।<br>
आसन्स्वधर्मनिरता सदा सन्मार्गवर्त्तिन॥ ( म-नि-तन्त्र)</p>
<p>Others wealth was looked upon as a piece of mud People were always religiously inclined and had recourse to all good ways and good will</p>
<p><strong>न मिथ्या भाषिण केचिन्न प्रमादरता क्वचित्।<br>
न चौरा न परद्रोहकारका न दुराशया॥ ( म-नि-तन्त्र)</strong></p>
<p>No vain talk and false speeches, no idlemongering, no thefts, no deceptions, no cheating and no coveting</p>
<p>न मत्सरा नातिरुष्टा नातिलुब्धा न कामुका।<br>
सदन्त करणा सर्वे सर्वदानन्दमानसा॥ ( म-नि-तन्त्र)</p>
<p>No malice, no fury, no greed, no evil desires, but all were invariably good-hearted, happy nobleminded and ever joyful</p>
<p>Everybody was bound by honor and truth without any Witten documents which made natters as easy as clockwork Only the Rakshasa Brahmins like Ravana and other demons were mostly unscrupulous Men and even animals possessed moral mentality</p>
<p>The proof of the friendly spirit maintained among the living beings in Ramarajya could be seen in the lion and the elephant drinking water together on the shores of the same river without hurting each other, in the cow and the tiger freely roaming about in the forest with a friendly attitude, the former being able to graze fearlessly without being molested by the latter and in the wolt and the lamb moving closely. People were not to die in early age and young men would</p>
<p>not succumb to death before old men and this was the rule of the Rule of Rama</p>
<p>Untruth was an extraordinary thing and a rarity No teachers to teach falsehood like some of the lawyers and no false affidavits encouraged No false statement, no false speeches, no false assurances, no false promises, no false hopes held out, no false engagements (with Indians), no diplomatic tactics tantamounting to ultimate dishonesty, no insincerity with the expressions of sweet words Selfishness was never allowed to spring or sprout, but was generally burried down underground</p>
<p>All in all straightforwardness to be scen throughout The Dharmic and Paramarthic tendency that existed even among animals in those golden days cannot be traced among men even with education to-day</p>
<p>The heroism of men comprised in actually waking the sleeping tiger in his den and then killing him, unlike the present day Shikar of making a number of arrangements before hand and thereafter shooting the animals in a womanly manner in company with women and getting hold of the dead body of the tiger and gettting</p>
<p>photographed and exhibiting their false heroism. Many animals such as elephants, horses, dogs, parrots andeven serpents were found to be faithful till a few centuries ago, but to-day see how we find a large number of men faithless, not possessing the good qualities of even animals. Unfortunately even the best breed of horses are fast disappearing with the advent of the motor-car</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>In regard to the matter of the loss of knowledge referied to by me in page 145 I find that several tables for the calculations of the places of the planets are missing from the time of Vikramarha and it would appear that errors are being committed by astrologers for the last thousand (1000) years. It is therefore necessary that the position of astrology and astronomy should be reconciled and calculations arrived at Unfortunately there had been neither nautical almanacs nor Hindu Observatories for a long time 1 comparative study, however, of the Hindu and Western systems will greatly benefit the students of astronomy</p>
<p>Dealing with the subject of Rama&rsquo;s birth there are some discrepancies just as Tulasidas Ramayana &amp; Jyotisha Kalpadruma fixing Monday, and the other Ramayanas Wednesday as his birth-day The following Telugu poem is one found in Sahasranama Ramayana denoting Wednesday, besides other Telugu poems from other books fixing</p>
<p>Wednesday—</p>
<p><strong>మధుమాసము సితపక్షము<br>
బుధవారము &ldquo;క్షమి కటకము పునర్వసు నక్షా</strong></p>
<p>and electricity Scarcely do we come across to day the faithful Arab horse, the juvenile Pegu pony, the Kathiawar dancing horses or the Australian whalers or the intelligent class of parrots, except the circus demonstrations of animals trained for the purpose</p>

<p>Valmeeki does not give the day, but the follwing stanzas only are found in Balakanda—</p>
<p><strong>ततश्च द्वादशेमासे चैत्रे नावमिके तिथौ।<br>
नक्षत्रेऽदितिदैवत्ये स्वोच्चसस्थेषु पंचसु॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>ग्रहेषु कर्कटे लग्ने वाक्पताविन्दुना सह।<br>

<p><strong>कौसत्याऽजनयद्रामं सर्वलक्षणसंयुतम्।<br>
विष्णोरर्धं महाभागं पुत्रमैक्ष्वाकवर्धनम्॥</strong></p>
<p>There is difference of opinion with regard to Rama&rsquo;s Amsas of Vishnu, some stating as ¼, as ½ some &amp; others as¼ of the Amsa Valmıkı makes one full Vishnu in the <strong>चतुरायतन</strong> of Rama as follows (i.e) Rama half, Lakshmana ¼, Bharata 1/8 &amp; &amp; Satrughna 1/8th making in all the full Vishnu Note that we find the horoscopes of Bharata, Lakshmana &amp; Satrughna, the brothers of Sri Rama, as also that of Sita, given in several works, as such it is a mistake to call this ancient history of Rama as mythology</p>
<p>Thus I have given the ideal of good nature that generally prevailed in ancient times<br>
<em>But look at the deplorable conditions of the present black age of Kali as noted in Subhashita Ratna Bhandagara.</em></p>
<p>धर्म प्रव्रजितस्तप प्रचलितं सत्य च दूरं गत<br>
पृथ्वी मन्दबला नरा कपटिनः चित्तं च शाठ्यार्जितम्।<br>
राजानोऽर्थपरा न रक्षणपरा पुत्रा पितृद्वेषिणः<br>
साधुस्सीदति दुर्जन प्रभवति प्राप्ते कलौ दुर्युगे॥</p>
<p>Unfortunately the tendency to be indifferent towards Dharma or religion is encouraged and a delight created in committing sinful acts as per following—</p>
<p>धर्मप्रसङ्गादपि नाचरन्ति पापं प्रयत्नेन समाचरन्ति॥</p>
<p><em>Further the characteristic of the Brahmin of theKali Age isviviidly brought out in the following stanza—</em></p>
<p>राक्षसाः कलिमाश्रित्य जायन्ते ब्रह्मयोनिषु।<br>
ब्राह्मणानेव बाधन्ते तत्रापि श्रोत्रियान्द्विजान्॥</p>
<p>See how Bahmin cuts the Brahmin as diamond cuts the diamond The conduct of some of the Brahmins has cut off the very root of Brahminism and Hinduism toa large extent—</p>
<p><em>The mischievous tendency of the Kali era is to be seen in the encouragement of pride by the people at large as is elucidated in the following stanza of Yatırajastotra Pride is treated as one of the qualificatians of the day.—</em></p>
<p>विद्यानिपुणा क्यमित्यन्ये हृद्या धनिनो वयमित्यन्ये।<br>
सत्कुलजाता वयमित्यन्ये तेषु कलि परिपूर्णं मन्ये॥</p>
<p>While condemning pride Mandodari says to Ravana as per the following Urdu poem—</p>
<p>नाश हो जाता हये वोह जिसको के आता हपे गुरूर।<br>
साहिबे दीदार को अंधा बनाता हये गुरूर॥<br>
हाथसे एक अदने के नीचा दिखाता हये गुरूर।<br>
अकल से बाहर हये वोह, जिसमे समाता हये गुरूर॥</p>
<p>Remember, in those best precious times of the Ideal Civilization all people spoke and wrote the gods&rsquo; language the pure Girvana unlike the latterly adulterated languages that have been changing from time to time and are supposed to be improving century after century by philologists as they go on tracing the origin and derivations of the words from Sanskrit etc It will be further interesting to find that the then expert philologists were also in a position to study the language of animals which is one of the 64 arts <strong>(चतुष्षष्ठिकला)</strong> that an able man has to learn It is called <strong>(सर्वभृतऋतज्ञान)</strong> Sarvabhuta Ritajnana The wonder was that certain animals were also in a position to make their wants easily understood and obtain comfort and redress, but owing to gradual degeneration, things were changed and again had to improve and within the past few centuries mostly materialistic thought is found progressive We are coming from steamship to railways, railways to motor cars,</p>
<p>motors to airships according to the development of taste and advancements of the West. At the same time we have given up the study of our military science, Dhanurveda and Gaja and Asva Shastras and Nauka sastra (<strong>नाका शास्त्र</strong> navigation) and Pakshi Shastras Ayurveda the science of medicine was in full swing along with surgery The glory of our Silpas istra (Architecture— <strong>शिल्पशास्त्र</strong>) can be easily seen from the splendid strong spaciously built temples of Tanjore, Madura and several parts of India</p>
<p>From the most ancient civilization prevalent at the time of Rama&rsquo;s rule it is clear that it was full of moral principles comprising all in all religion, devotion, faithfulness, sincerity, love, affection, sympathy, charity, friendly spirit and heroism, so far as men were concerned Only Rakshasas, or whatever race of the South they might have belonged to, were considered to be uncharitable, full of tricks and dishonesty and hence their leaders were killed time after time</p>
<p>Sri Rama&rsquo;s rule had peace and rest,<br>
Ten thousand years Ayodhya blest<br>
The happy land no murrain knew,<br>
The flocks and herds increased and grew</p>
<p>No widowe mourned her murdered mate,<br>
No house was ever desolate<br>
The Earth her kindly fruits supplied,<br>
No harvest failed, no children died<br>
Unknown were want, disease and crime,<br>
So calm and so happy was the time</p>
<p>From the several works we also find the existence of different types of Aeroplanes (Vimanas) and their names We can easily believe this when we bring to our mind the present-day airships that are employed by men, not only to carry post from Karachi to London but also to enjoy music and honey-moon in the sky Hence there is no necessity for doubting in the then highly advanced civilization with the use of cars (Rathams) and airships, sometimes bothcombined</p>
<p>With regard to the manufacture of the said Vimanas etc, reference is made in Rig Veda One of the mantras dealing with the same is given below—</p>
<p>त्रयःपावयो मधुवाहने रथे सोमस्य वेनामनु विश्व इद्विदु।<br>
त्रयस्कम्भास स्कमितास आरभे त्रिर्नक्तयाथस्त्रिर्वश्विना दिवा॥</p>
<pre><code>                             (ऋ० अष्ट० १ अ० ३ व० ४ म० १ )
</code></pre>
<p>The construction of motor cars, steamships and airships worked out by steam, electricity and Vayu created in a particular manner, can be found in them There were special varieties of Vimanas made for the special use of semi-gods and kings with their special names and for special purposes They were intended to finish the travel of the whole world within 3 days in accordance with the following Rig Veda Mantra—</p>
<p>तिस्रक्षपस्त्रिरहाति व्रजद्भिर्नासत्या भुज्युमूहथु पतङ्गै।<br>
समुद्रस्य धन्वन्नार्द्रस्यपारे त्रिभीरथै शतपद्भिपडश्वै॥</p>
<pre><code>                   (ऋ० अष्ट० १ अ० ४ व० ४ म० ४ )
</code></pre>
<p>It is observed that Asvin played a great part in the constructions of these conveyances contributing towards what is called Jerfery and Turfery, meaning negative and positive</p>
<p>The power of Vayu was so generated, and handled with the particular systems and mechanisms, according to the knowledge, that existed among the ancient people They had their own ideas of the Thermometer, Barometer the chemical and condensing Hygrometers, which were discovered by Sanctorio, Toricelli Mon-de-Saucer, the western scientists in the years 1590 AD 1643 AD and so on. The ancient scientists that were able to drive Vimanas with their own fashion of simplified methods, by controlling the power of Vayu, understood the physical properties of air, and gaseous atoms thereof the elasticity and the temperature</p>
<p>of the air, the compressibility, the atmospheric pressure the conduction, the corruction, the distribution of terrestrial temperature, the subject of radiation, the dew point, the wind and storms, the fogs and clouds, such as the cirrus, the cumulus, the stratus and the hail and all such details pertaining to Vay uchakra Shastra, <strong>(वायुचक्रशास्त्र)</strong> which was practically mastered by them, but for which they would not have been able to travel from world to world</p>
<p>Rama had returned from Ceylon in the Pushpak Vimana which belonged to the god of wealth, Kubera, as stated below—</p>
<p><em><strong>Is not the wondrous chariot mine<br>
Named Pushpak wrought by hands divine</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The praise which Ravan seized of old,<br>
Victorious over the god of gold</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Numerous works Concerning Rama and His Nama.</strong></p>
<p>Sri Rama&rsquo;s good name and His goodness and His goodwill has been so greatly admired that a number of Ramayanas have been compiled by several authors after the original Ramayana written by Valmeeki They comprise Adhyatma Ramayana, Ananda Ramayana, Adbhuta Ramayana, Agnivesya Ramayana, the splendid Yoga Vasishta Ramayana, Mantra Ramayana, Moola Ramayana, Kadamba Ramayana, Tatva Sangraha Ramayana, Sata Kandhara Ramayana, Sahasra</p>
<p>Kandhara Ramayana, Kamba Ramayana in Tamil poetry, Tulasidas Ramayana in Hindi poems, Bhaskara Ramayana, Sahasranama Ramayana, Ranganatha Ramayana, Gopinatha Ramayana and Molla Ramayana in Telugu poems There are also <strong>मौद्गल्यरामायणम्, भार्गवरामायणम्, हनुमद्रामायणम्</strong> in Sanskrit <strong>निरोष्ठगमायण</strong> is in Marathi by Moropunth Ramayana written before Valmeekiis referred to in Buddha charita by Asva Ghosha But we must note that Valmeeki was of the <strong>समकाल</strong>contemporary of Sri RamaHence all importance attaches Valmeeki. There isalso च्यवन रामायण Iunderstand that there is a large collection of 108 Ramayanas out of which 25 are available in a Muth in the north It is said that there is also <strong>जैनरामायणम्</strong> in Prakrit, <strong>बौद्ध रामायणम्</strong>in Pali and even <strong>क्रैस्तव गमायणम्</strong> and <strong>यवन रामायणम्</strong> Only some reference is found in connection with <strong>बोधायन रामायणम्</strong> and <strong>भरद्वाज रामायणम्</strong></p>
<p>There is also the work called <strong>रामायणसंग्रह</strong> by Narayana Pandit dealing on Dvaita philosophy besides the <strong>रामचरितमानसम्</strong> and so on including several miscellaneous minor Ranayanas &amp;c It is found in books <strong>चरितं रघुनाथस्य शतकोटि प्रविस्तरं</strong> but when you take the following sloka into consideration it will be seen that this refers only to the number of Letters that occur in Ramayana at a rough calculation</p>
<p>ततस्सवर्णयामास राघव ग्रन्थकोटिभि।<br>
एकैक मक्षरप्रोक्त महापातक नाशनम्॥</p>
<p>This may be explained in the following manner i.e, 24,000 verses of Ramayana when multiplied by an average of 32 give the number of letters roughly as 7,68,000 which is the figure so far as Valmeeki&rsquo;s present Ramayana is concerned, but, when the letters of other Ramayanas are added the number is found to exceed a Crore of letters so as to justify the rough and general statement contained in the above sloka</p>
<p>Note that all Ramayanas are intended to give Mukti 01 Ayana Hence follow the Shastraic Religious Commandments and the Virtuous Actions of the Great <strong>धर्ममूर्ति, धर्मधुरन्धर, धर्मावतार, धर्मदाता, धर्मप्रभु,</strong> and <strong>धर्मवत्सल Sri Rama</strong> by doing the needfulas mentioned below and obtain Ayana—</p>

<p>A point has to be noted as to the advanced civilization with limited engagements, contributing towards peace of mind, and less disturbed happiness Thanks to the well-trained, truly educated parrot, that does the greatest good to you, by reminding you of expressing the popular names of God, such as <strong>रामकृष्ण, राधेकृष्ण, रंग रंगा</strong> and singing the slokas from <strong>मुकुन्दमाला</strong> etc and helping towards relieving you from sin, if any, by constantly dinning the God&rsquo;s names in your ears To be reminded of God, and to think of Him, now and again. through the instrumentality of a manlike speaking bird is one of the chief objects of keeping such a parrot or Myna in the house with great care as they are the Bhakti Rasa entertaining birds</p>
<p>Any number of notes and Remembrancers placed on your table, are nothing when compared with the God&rsquo;s name, Rama &amp; Krishna etc actually, uttered and poured in your ears off and on and your devotion is made to advance day by day</p>
<p>Even a parrot may be considered a better leader, as he leads you towards the path of religion, than the noisy Social Deform Leader, that drags you in the field of sin, by infusing the spirit of going in for spirits, the spirit of sacriligious atutude, and the spirit of inter-marriages by sacrificing the</p>

<p>, or Ramamadas (రామమాడ</p>
<p>), viz, the gold coins weighing 10 pagodas each (A nishka in Sanskrit)</p>
<p>Note the Mantra of Sri Sookta—</p>
<p>धनमग्निर्धन वायु धन सूर्यो धन वसु।<br>
धनमिन्द्रो बृहस्पतिर्वरुण धनमश्नुते॥</p>
<p>If you do good Pooja of Dhana Mahalakshmi <strong>(धनमहालक्ष्मी)</strong> you will make a large Rami (రామి</p>

<p>Sip Rama Pada Teertha, a real Ramarasa(<strong>रामरस</strong> Sans) and get purified thereby and receive the best blessings of Rama by His Ramavara the Rama&rsquo;s boon (రామవరము), so that you will be in a position to give a heavy Ramatola (<strong>रामटोला</strong> Mar) blow to Yamahınkaras, producing a loud Ramaratta (<strong>रामरट्टा</strong> Mar.) sound which will certainly frighten them to run away and Ramadootas <strong>रामदूत</strong> will receive you with much consideration and respect and will take your soul directly to any place of bliss you like or Vaikuntha, the Ramanivas or Ramadhama <strong>रामधाम</strong>proper, throughthe Grand Express ArchiradiTrunk Road or Devayana Mail in one of the splendid airships, specially manufactured and suitable to any atmosphere and able to cross any region, without allowing to be molested by Yama or his ervants You may either Join away in the Light Body of God Rama with a rapid photographic flash or stay for such time as you may be destined without recourse to Dhoomadı Marga owing to Ramapratap, the splendour of Rama according to the assurance of Ramavakya <strong>(रामवाक्य)</strong></p>
<p>I have already dealt with the subject of the holy foot water of God in page 84 of this book,</p>
<p>yet in connection with the Rama Pada Teertha also, I am inclined to give further authorities on the subject As per Sandilya Sutra No 67, theimportant work on Bhakti—Meeramsa, We find—</p>
<p>पादोदक तु पाद्यमव्याप्ते॥</p>
<p>I also refer to the stanza found in Nrisimha Purana (Adhyaya 59, Sloka 46) dealing with the value of the Padodaka of God which is given below—</p>
<p>गङ्गाप्रयाग गय पुष्कर नैमिषाणि<br>
पुण्यानि यानि कुरुजाङ्गल यामुनानि ।<br>
कालेनतीर्थ सलिलानि पुनन्ति पापान्<br>
पादोदक भगवत प्रपुनाति सद्य॥</p>
<p>In Venkatachala Mahatmya it is said that there are 3 crores and 50 lakhs of Teerthas in the three lokas as per the following quotation :—</p>
<p>तिस्र कोट्योर्धकोटी च तीर्थानि भुवनत्रये॥</p>
<p>But God&rsquo;s Pada Teertha excels all the 3½crores of Teerthas situated in the three worlds It is an instrument, that enables the man to float off the Samsara</p>
<p><strong>गोविन्दचरणद्वन्द्व मधुनो महदद्भुतम्।<br>
यत्पायिनो न मुह्यन्ति मुह्यन्ति तदपायिन॥</strong></p>
<p>The value of the feet of God is so great that by the very touch of the dust of the feet of Rama Ahalya got back her life from the stone form. The following Telugu stanza will be found interesting :—</p>
<p>ఉండ్రావోరిదురాత్మక అండ్రాప్రాసంబుకౌలకివ్వందగునా !<br>
ఆండ్రా మపదముసోకిన గుండ్రాతికి కాలువచ్చి గుఁగునఁడి చేశా ॥</p>
<p>Here is what Tulasidas has stated in his popular Ramayana—</p>
<p>जे चरण शिव अज पूज्य रज शुभ परशि मुनिपत्नीतरी।<br>
नख निर्गता सुरवन्दिता त्रैलोक्य पावनि सुरसरी॥</p>
<p>ध्वज कुलिश अकुश कजयुत वन फिरत कटक जिनलहे।<br>
पदकज द्वद्वमुकद राम रमेश नित्य भजामहे॥</p>
<p>Remember that from the feet of God the universally respected the universe purifying Ganges, the queen river is originated</p>
<p>Instead of man spoiling the system of his body by drugging with medicines against the fine principles of science and getting all kinds of disadvantages due to drugs, it is better to drink the medicine of Rama Rasayana by following the rules of</p>
<p>hygiene and Law of Nature in view of the fact that in spite of any kind and any number of medicines, the man is bound to pass away from this world, as per the stanza given below—</p>
<p>इद शरीर परिणाम पेशल पतत्यवश्य श्लथ सन्धि जर्जरम्।<br>
किमौषधे क्लिश्यसि मूढ दुर्मते निरामय राम (कृष्ण) रसायन पिब॥</p>
<p>Oh! bad-minded selfish fool, your body is bound to undergo the changes in system according to the Law of Nature and is bound to fall down owing to death and the usual decay Why spoil your body by taking medicines which are mostly palliatives and only convert one disease into another? Take the medicine of Rama (Krishna) Rasayana, as Rama&rsquo;s help is essential to get you all energy and vitality even if you take the medicines prepared and prescribed by the best of doctors Remember that the latest advanced scientists advocate only naturopathy by condemning all schools of medicine such as allopathy, homeopathy, chromopathy, hydropathy and electropathy</p>
<p>Firstly understand the value of Ramapada <strong>(रामपद)</strong> the word Rama, that serves the purpose of a stepping stone in procuring Rama Pada <strong>(रामपाद)</strong> Rama&rsquo;s Feet and gradually secure Ramapada</p>
<p><strong>(रामपद)</strong> the abode of Sri Rama, described in the Vedas as<strong>तद्विष्णोः परमं पद</strong> which you will procure quickly by your realising the miracle of Ramapada Seva <strong>(रामपादसेवा)</strong> and the sanctity of Rama Pada Teertha, <strong>(रामपादतीर्थ)</strong> which gets you (<strong>रामता</strong> Mar) or Ramaship viz, the virtuous qualities of Rama and ultimately obtains Ramapadavi (<strong>रामपदवी</strong>) the very Ramatva (<strong>रामत्व</strong> Hin ) viz., Sayujya as per the following authority of RamatapaniUpanishad <strong>रामतापनी उपनिषद—</strong></p>
<p>सदा रामोह मस्मीति तत्त्वत प्रवदन्ति ये।<br>
नते ससारिणो नून राम एव न सशय॥</p>
<p>The above is consistant with the Mahavakya Chathushtayam viz, ( 1 ) <strong>प्रज्ञानं ब्रह्म</strong> (2) <strong>अहं ब्रह्मास्मि</strong> ( 3 ) <strong>तत्त्वमसि</strong> (4) <strong>अयमात्मा ब्रह्म</strong> the four greatest of great key notes of philosophy.</p>
<p>Note the wonderful capacity of Rama who is able to Ramener (<strong>रामने</strong> Fre) i.e, bring back the people from Yamaloka if it pleased Him, as He did during Lanka War as follows—</p>
<p>To life and strength my friends recall,<br>
And bring them back from Yama&rsquo;s hall.</p>
<p>See how Rama conferred boons upon his duti- ful servants and warriors who were killed in the war as per the following :—</p>
<p>Their strength repaired, their gashes healed<br>
Whose torrents dyed the battle-field<br>
Restored from Rama&rsquo;s dark domain<br>
The Vanar regions filled the plain</p>
<p>Carry out Ramahoti Vratam <strong>(रामकोटिव्रतम्)</strong> of writing one Crore of names of Rama in a book form to be presented in Ramakshetra in Bhadrachalam or elsewhere and dedicate the same to Rama as Ramarpanam (<strong>रामार्पणम्</strong> Tel) and obtain the virtue thereof</p>
<p>The pleasant past time is still fresh in my memory of writing Rama names in hundreds of chits and rolled up with wheat flour and made into pills and given to the large number of fishes including the Ramalu (రామలు Tel) variety, in the large tank known as Rayasagar in Kankroli in Mewar, the seat of Dvarakanathjee and enjoying the sight of the fishes swallowing the Rama tickets by following the example of certain devotees of Rama I do not know how Ramamulian (_(&lt;MISSING_FIG href=&quot;../books_images/U-IMG-1724758823782713.png&quot;/&gt;) Tam) the silvery sea-fishes can be supplied with these Rama-name-chits in the sea</p>
<p>It is desirable to secure the pictures of Rama containing thousands of names of Rama written therein and preserve them as curios</p>
<p><strong>श्री राम रामेति जना ये जपन्ति च सर्वदा।<br>
तेषां भुक्तिश्च मुक्तिश्च भविष्यति न सशय॥</strong></p>
<p>It is worth noting as to how Hanuman&rsquo;s whole body contained Rama names, just like the development of any bacilliin the system of body, which was shown by the powerful Hanuman (the son of the Wind-god) to the audience by tearing up his own body, when he was taunted by rich Rajas, merchants and Jewellers, when he threw away pearl after pearl by biting each of them from the pearl necklace presented to him by Sita, because they did not contain Rama names though rich and most valuable As the Ram (<strong>राम</strong> Per) viz, the obedient Hanuman the reputed Ramabhakta and the great ambassador of Rama, the well known Ramaduta <strong>(रामदूत)</strong> wanted everything with him to contain the names of Rama, without which it was useless to him, he would not care to have the pearl necklace Sri Sankaracharya has also pointed out as to how Hanuman loved Rama names in his Hanumatbhujangastotra dealing with Ramanamali (<strong>रामनामालि</strong>) as follows—</p>
<p>भजे लक्ष्मण प्राण रक्षाविदक्ष भजे तोषितानेक गीर्वाण पक्षम्।<br>
भजे घोर संग्राम सीमाह ताक्ष भजेराम नामालि सप्राप्त रक्षम्॥</p>
<p>Write, write and write Rama&rsquo;s names on fine Ramette (<strong>रामेत्</strong> Fre.) note paper, whatever the number of Rame (<strong>राम्</strong> Fre) meaning reams of paper may be exhausted and Ramasser (<strong>रामासर</strong> Fre) meaning, gather all information pertaining to Rama like Ramandadı (రామండాడి) congregations.</p>
<p>Make the words of Rama rain<br>
And you will find all kinds of gain<br>
Avoid therefore all and every stain<br>
So as to see no pain no slain<br>
Trust yourself in Rama in main<br>
Without wasting the precious life in vain<br>
Connect yourself with virtues chain<br>
Making the best use of your brain,<br>
And get peace and prosperity to pour like rain.</p>
<p>[LG]</p>
<p>The constant writing of the names of Rama is nothing short of drafts or hundis of merit to be drawn after demise cashable in the Celestial Bank of Virtue Hence always rightly write Rama, utter Rama pray to Rama and always invite, invoke and worship Rama and request Rama to confer all good on you together with health and wealth</p>
<p>Though according to the derivation of the word <strong>रामयतीतिरामः</strong> it is clear that He is everywhere</p>
<p>yet, when Gajendra was extremely suffering from the agony due to the clutch of the technically law-discussing omnivorous crocodile and felt utterly hopeless and much disgusted, he began to accuse the Omnipotent and Omnipresent God; so much so that he expressed a serious doubt as to the very existence of that all pervading God and stated as follows—</p>
<p>కలడందురు హీనులయెడ<br>
గలడందురు పరమయోగిగణములపాల<br>
గలడందురన్నిదిశలను<br>
గలడు లండ నెడువాడుకలడో లేడో</p>
<p>After hearing the above remarks made by His Bhakta the Gajendra, Rama was moved and instantaneously appeared before him and saved Gajendra by killing the crocodile and proved the popular Telugu saying—</p>
<p>అంతా రామమయం ఈ జగదంతా రామమయం॥</p>
<p>Note that the all-pervading powerful Rama seated from His Universally and Automatically situated &ldquo;Everywhere&rdquo; Throne makes every one to bow Him even unconsciously and gives every one whatever that pleases Him according to the services rendered to Him as per the popular Hindi saying—</p>
<p>रामझरूखेबैठके सबका मुजरालेत।<br>
जैसी जिस्की चाकरी वैसा उस्कृदेत॥</p>
<p>Associate with true Rama Bhaktas without indulging in vain talk, club gossips, vindictive recriminations and useless discussions such as—</p>
<p>काकस्यकतिवा दन्ता मेषस्याण्ड कियत्पलम्।<br>
इतिचिन्ता विनोदेन कालोगच्छ त्यधीमताम्॥</p>
<p>It is a great pity that a good deal of time is wasted without spending at least a portion of it in studying the works containing evena shade of Rama&rsquo;s name such as—</p>
<p>रामाभिषेके मदविह्वलाया हस्ताच्युतो हेमघटस्तरुण्या।<br>
सोपानमार्गेण करोतिशब्द ठठठठंठठठठठठठः॥</p>
<p>It is regrettable that club has become a substitute for a temple, and service to God is converted into service to belly and in some instances it can be said to be a dignified toddy-shop along with its being a rendezvuous for discussions resulting only in No Rehef to countrymen but cosmopolitan ideas are misapplied in carrying out the imitation of European life, and many of their good things are lost sight of, such as their conservatism of keenly attending to service in</p>
<p>church on all important days and their promptitude, punctuality etc From the king to peasant they attend church service on Sundays, X-mas days and even on coronation days, whereas many of our educated men of status and position think it beneath their diginity to go to temples, which they think are intended for the illiterate folk Though holders of cosmopolitan views, many a European does not like the European ladies marrying Indians and the ladies so married are not admitted in society The Indian who expresses cosmopolitan views has no stamina to correspond with Europeans of status and position to enter into matrımonial relation with his son or daughter The utmost cosmopolitan work turned out is by taking to the liqours and disagreeable animal food encouraging Jiva Himsa and smoking of cigars</p>
<p>Look at the striking paragraph, published in the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; of the 4th June 1933, page 8, coloumn 3. under the heading of &ldquo;Sodden with Drink&rdquo; from which will be observed the effect of the modern civilisation and the pleasures of society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night after night they drink&quot;says Dr. Salter M P, &ldquo;and sitting in the smoking room</p>
<p>of the House of Commons soak all evening until they become stupid&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have seen&rdquo; he further declares &ldquo;Cabinet ministers go into the House in a condition in which they could hardly stand&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owing to club drinks clubbing with liquors and further clubbing with over and untimely eatings and the clubbing of playing cards till 8-30 pm, along with the clubbing of trash readings contained in newspapers, no time is available even to enjoy the company of one&rsquo;s family members and children</p>
<p>What a pity that the ideas of <strong>काव्य शास्त्र विनोदेन कालो गच्छति धीमताम्</strong>, have been altogether abandoned and has become out of fashion</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have recourse to Ramaduhai (<strong>रामदुहाई</strong>Hin &amp; <strong>रामनी आण</strong> Guj) i.e, taking oath on Rama&rsquo;s name Strictly stick to true speech like Ramavachana (<strong>राम वचन</strong>Guj) and as per Ramavachakam (&lt;MISSING_FIG href=&rdquo;../books_images/U-IMG-1724759119782714.png&quot;/&gt;) but if you are given to speak untruth, perhaps you may have to become a. Ramajana (<strong>रामजन</strong> Hin) or a Varnasankara or take the life of a Ramcat (Eng) in the next birth Who knows you may not become a dog and drag the Ramase (<strong>रामास</strong> Fre) cart used by Esquimos on the ice-bergs near the north pole?</p>
<p>Neither speak untruth nor submit yourself to the arrows of Ramila <strong>(रामिल</strong>) the Cupid as you have to control the senses for getting Vyragya and developing Ramabhakti <strong>(रामभक्ति)</strong> Do not commit any sin which may subject you to be attacked by Ramakka (&lt;MISSING_FIG href=&quot;../books_images/U-IMG-1724759222782715.png&quot;/&gt; Tam) a kind of pox Avoid the trade of Rama, meaning indigo in Sanskrit which is against Shastras.</p>
<p>If you wish to become Ramnable (<strong>राम्नाबल</strong> Fr.) viz, reclaimable, you will have to perform Prayaschittams and make Ramabhakti**(रामभक्ति)** and only by uttering his names and seeking his favour your sins will be washed and your situation becomes Ramandable (<strong>रामान्दाबल्</strong>Fre) i.e repairable In fact the Rama-nama is a substitute for a number of (krichhras) <strong>कृच्छ्र</strong>and when one does not find the requisite, quantity of gold or silver to be given in connection with Prayaschittam ceremony he can utter the names of God in its stead, and derive the requisite virtue.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t adopt the modern civilized methods of speaking untruth as there is no greater sin than that Leave it to such of those educated men having black heart along with black coat, who take pleasure in speaking untruth and keep on encouraging the same and fomenting strife and thereby</p>
<p>earn money on one side and spend away in diabetes on the other God save the people from the hands of those, who are the Teachers of Untruth and who are often found indulging in various technicalities What a wonder that the law market has become full of law touts, even having no holidays during principal days Sunday is the day on which mischievous work is more vigorously turned out Parents&rsquo; ceremonies is a forgotten empire. Many of these selfish lot of men will only <strong>टीच्</strong> you <strong>अनीति</strong> butsubsequently <strong>चीट्</strong>vou and practice Ramailage (<strong>रामिलाज्</strong> Fre) on you, meaning scrape off even the hair of your skins until you become totally penniless Never submit to their Ramadouer (<strong>रामदोर्</strong> Fre) or cajolaries Carefully watch their shrewdness and the plans of deception which are practised in a nice manner like the Raminagrobis (<strong>रामिनाग्राबिस्</strong> Fre) the Grimalkin How deplorable it is when we find the continuous rampancy (Eng) and the over-spread of such men that has brought ruination of many people and families. Do not even look at them, but treat them as Ramji (<strong>रामजी</strong> Per.) decoy birds, who are always engrossed in their refined ways of decoity It is hoped that Rama will soon reform the rougishness of the wrong men running in the world, robbing</p>
<p>the people by rubbing on any side they like for rupees, annas and pies, which alone is their motto or Ramath Gamath</p>
<p>So long as you are connected with such men, it is no use of annointing Ramollissante (<strong>रामोलिस्यन्थ्</strong> Fre) emolient to the hair and for the body or applying Remollissement (<strong>रामोलिस्मेन्थ्</strong> Fre) to soften the brain as it will be subjected to worries and annoyances due to the associations of demoniac persons</p>
<p>Avoid hanging upon these cunning men, who make use of you as a tool to gain their machinations in your name under certain privileges and in the name of instructions, for which you are not responsible You should also observe as to the wrong done to you by some by secretly giving out your facts to your opponents thougn engaged by you Instead of spoiling your time and money in bad ways sacrificing all noble principles and submitting yourself to all humiliations at the hands of these crafty men and knocking about to their houses like a dog and carrying heavy bundles like an ass even by sacrificing your ablutions, prayers and the duty of worshipping God how peaceful and honourable will it be to become a Ramapanth (<strong>राम्पान्थ्</strong> Fre) of Rama viz,</p>
<p>Ramadasa instead of becoming a slave of these men and others</p>
<p><strong>Ramadasa— राम दास</strong></p>
<p>A few words on the value of becoming Rama Dasa or the servant of God, given below will be worth noting</p>
<p>To become a slave of God excels the position of holding even a kingdom as the latter is entirely transitory It is recognised by the Shastras that one shall not only become the slave of God, but may become even the slave of the slave of God as stated below in Pandava Gita by Akrura:—</p>
<p>अहतु नारायण दास दास दासस्य दासस्यच दास दास।<br>
अन्येभ्य ईशो जगतो नराणामस्मादहचान्यतरोस्मि लोके॥</p>
<p>Further your devotion to God should be so humble and submissive that you should completely give up your egoism to such an extent as to claim to become the servant of the servant of that mightiest of the mighty, the Almighty and serve Him with all your might and offer your mite and Seva. See the following—</p>
<p>मज्जन्मन फलमिद मधुकैटभारे मत्प्रार्थनीय मदनुग्रह एष एव।<br>
त्वद्भृत्य भृत्य परिचारक भृत्य भृत्य भृत्यस्य भृत्य इतिमाॅ स्मर लोकनाथ॥</p>
<p>Thus become a true slave and servant of God, unlike the methods of adopting the meaningless official forms, which are followed only under compulsion, like &ldquo;Your most obedient servant,&rdquo; the sincerity of which is known to all, and the wordings of addressing any person as Dear Sir&quot;, &ldquo;Yours sincerely&rdquo; and even &ldquo;Fraternally&rdquo;, the forms amounting to mere formality without conveying true meanings thereof.</p>
<p>Look at the Mahatmya of those becoming the Dasas of God as described in Padmottara Purana:—</p>
<p>श्रीकृष्ण हरि गोविन्द दास नाम्नादिको जन।<br>
य कश्चित् याति कलुषं सर्व तन्नाम कीर्तनात्॥etc॥</p>
<p>In this connection, I offer my humblest salutations to my most revered, highly esteemed, much respected father Diwan Bahadur Lodd Krishnadasa, an exceptionally true devotee and Dasa of Lord Krishna who was pleased to give me the name Govindadasa</p>
<p>If there are any disputes in the family they may be referred to a Ramabata <strong>(रामबटाइ)</strong> arbitration, rather than depending upon a number of Judges changing from time after time and keeping up the endless litigation concomitantly with the endless Samsara to continue for ever, if not for</p>
<p>generations like Ramachaki <strong>(रामचाकी)</strong> the whirligig and the whirlpool.</p>
<p>Do not use Ramathhathhiyun articles (<strong>रामठाठियुं</strong> Guj) or live in a dilapidated house</p>
<p>Though the country of Gujarat is associated with Krishnabhakti owing to the seat of Krishna, the town of Dwaraka being situated within the precincts of Gujarat and the temple of Sri Ranchhodrayjee, the Lord of Dwaraka, in Dakor near Ahmedabad and though the influence of the Vaishnavism of the Vallabha cult predominates and sometimes working its own havoc, still Rama&rsquo;s name is as popular as in any part of India.</p>
<p>There are several Ramayanas composed in Gujarati poems, such as those by (1) Giridhar, (2) Vishnudas and (3) Uddhava, and the other known as Ahalya Ramayana These are so beautifully sung in different Ragas that Bhaktırasa and Veerarasa exuberantly ooze out like streams of water, and people were found to be kept spell bound while hearing the Ramayana, Mahabharatha, and the popular Okhaharan, etc But unfortunately since recent times people having become mad after becoming Matriculates and Graduates, with the main idea of entering into service the taste</p>
<p>for oriental literatures has died out. What a pity that in the face of &ldquo;hand to mouth&rdquo; eking out livelihood through the means of English education and in spite of numerous disappointments without getting service in Government or other public institutions, still people have taken a fancy to this formal machanical education of a limited scope.</p>
<p>Just as Kabir was the Mohammedan Ramabhakta there was also an other Mohammedan Ramabhakta known as Suleman Bhagat The names of Sita and Rama have been somehow or other very popular and they seem to have been imbibed, from the time one is in the womb of his mother In every village Ramayana was being read and heard every year and many a Brahmin families lived thereby. No doubt many Kavis, Sanths, Vyasas and others performing splendid Bhajana are not to be found to-day to our regret.</p>
<p>Show regard to a Ramayani(<strong>रामायणी</strong> Guj) the Ramayana Expounder and respect the ancient Rishi Ramoda (<strong>रामोद</strong> Hin.) Teach Ramayana to boys and girls and give instructions to those who are desirous of learning any of the works on Rama given by me in pages 168 and 169 of this book.</p>
<p>The name of that one God Rama who took Ramavatara find place in all the 18 Puranas from which it can be gathered as to the extent of his popularity The following is the Sanskritised Gujarati stanza, which I quote here from the Giridhar Ramayana :—</p>
<p>अवतार अनामय भूमितल विचरी ममवाणी करी सुफलम्।<br>
कृतपूरण कामकृपाल प्रभो प्रणमामि रमापति रामविभो॥</p>
<p>Use a Rambha stick (<strong>रांभा</strong> Hin) used by Sanyasins or religious students as staff</p>
<p>Need not worry about Ramanujasampradaya**(रामानुज)** or Ramanandi <strong>( रामानंदी)</strong> 01Ramavat <strong>(रामावत्)</strong> or Ramavallabhi <strong>(रामवल्लभी)</strong> or Ramadasi**(रामदासी)** or Ramasanehi <strong>(रामसनेही)</strong> or Remadev <strong>(रामदेव्</strong>) cults or the cult of Ramakrishnapunth <strong>(रामकृष्णपन्थ्)</strong> as all of them lead you to the path of becoming the devotee of Rama The special feature of Ramasanehi is only to utter the name of Rama louder and louder.</p>
<p>Dont become indifferent regarding important matters by uttering the words, RamayaswastiRavanayaswasti <strong>(रामायस्वस्ति रावणायस्वस्ति)</strong> meaning let Rama prosper or Ravana prosper, as no sane man would like to have Ravanarajya, full of</p>
<p>injustice, misrule and anarchy besides extraordinary exhorbitance. Always expect to enjoy the happiness of Ramarajya and prostrate before Him as under—</p>
<p>श्रीरामचद्र रघुपुंगव राजवर्य राजेन्द्र राम रघुनायक राघवेश।<br>
राजाधिराज रघुनदन रामराज भोरामभद्र सुरराजनमोस्तु तुभ्यम्॥</p>
<p>Thinhing that I may be doing some substantial service to the cause of Rama and Ramabhaktas by entering deeply into the subject of Ramacharcha <strong>(रामचर्चा)</strong> which has however developed itself into a Ramakahani(<strong>रामकहानी</strong> Hin.) a long story as it were But when my Ramaabhimani <strong>(रामाभिमानि)</strong> and Ramanamabhimani <strong>(रामनामाभिमानि)</strong> friends will take into account that the labour spent by me in this direction is worthy of consideration in view of the deep interest theyare bound to evince owing to their love for Rama. I hope they will not feel it cumbersome or tedious but the more they come across with the Ramic usages the greater will they like them By investigating and introducing the Ramic usages derived from the word Rama, as a devotee of Rama I thought, I will be following at least a portion of the work of Valmeeki who though expressed Mara-Mara in the place of Rama-Rama</p>
<p>yet derived the virtue of uttering Rama-Rama I am sure that Rama Bhaktas will like this long Rama nama Malika given by me though the same may appear to be like Ramaragada (<strong>रामरगडा</strong> Mar) owing to the overcrowding of the words connected with the name of Rama Somehow or other I have entered into this Ramasamudra <strong>(रामसमुद्र)</strong> which I have to rammer through in the ears of Rama&rsquo;s devotees by the grace of Rama, along with the Samsarasamudra.</p>
<p>As a Ramosseur (<strong>रामोसार</strong> Fre) I have done this Ramasis (<strong>रामसी</strong> Fre) the collection of Ramic names which has taken the shape of a Rama Tree and which are after all the Rameuse (<strong>राम्यु</strong> Fre) the branchings of that one word Rama, of That One God. It is consistant with the saying <strong>रामनुंरामायण.</strong></p>
<p>As a Ramifier <strong>(रामीफयर)</strong> Fre) I have done my duty in collecting the Ramic words based on the word Rama, the value of which knows no bounds as expressed by Valmeeki, Tulasıdas, Vasistha and others Really speaking the utterance of the word Rama itself is equal to the drinking of nectar</p>
<p>The utterance of the word Rama is the passport to get at the Rampe (<strong>राम्प्</strong> Fre) viz, the</p>
<p>flight i.e. the ladder that leads to Ramadham Hence it is essential to be Rampante (<strong>राम्पान्थ्</strong> Fre) and study the Ramic literature to gain the purpose of becoming a Ramankandan <strong>(ராமன் கண்)</strong> the seer of Rama (like the seers of Mantras the Rishis) and obtain salvation</p>
<p>One may even prostrate before thethree Ramas viz., Sri Rama, Balarama and Parasurama along with the main Rama of Trimoorthi Swarupa the controller of the Trinity that likes to be called Sitarama, Janakirama etc. He is also Jayarama</p>
<p>Owing to the popularity of Rama, the word Rama has been connected with many names There are several proper names such as— Surya Ram, Govind Ram, Bala Ram, Ichha Ram, Mansukh Ram, Daya Rama, Siva Ram, Sankar Ram, Raja Ram and so forth, which are well known to the people The name given to one of the intelligent commedians in the court of an Andhra king was called Tenali Rama who is also known with reversible designation Vikatakavi<strong>विकटकवि</strong> 5 4 3 2 1 and it so happens that a glutton is called a Sapat Rama and a squat figure known as Ramassee <strong>(रामासी)</strong> in French is called a DadiRaman and is generally applied to a person</p>
<p>of lethargic temperament Dandaga Raman is one who claims his pay without doing work. Note that one of the names of the Mohammedan months is called Ramadhan (<strong>रामधान्</strong> Urd.) and a machine for driving stone is named a Rammer (Eng) and the barrel of a gun styled a Ramrod in English language</p>
<p>I have consulted several books regarding the usages of the above Ramic names I have referred to the works in the languages of (1) Sanskrit, (2) Hindi, (3) Gujarati, (4) Marathi, (5) Tamil, (6) Telugu, (7) Bengali, (8) Malayalam, (9) Urdu, (10) Canarese, (11) Pali, (12) Tibetan, (13) English, (14) Urıya, (15) French, (16) Latin, (17) Persian and (18) Arabic</p>
<p>Thus I have given a number of popular usages of the words connected with the word Rama and utilised in several forms conveying different meanings as adopted in the different languages Let us close the chapter by singing—</p>
<p>राम राम राम सीता— राम राम राम सीता।</p>
<p>But Lo the Gujarati proverb says—</p>
<p><strong>दुखे भजे सहु रामने सुखे भजे न कोय।<br>
सुखे भजे जो रामने दुख शुं करवाहोय॥</strong></p>
<p>The following popular song sung like national anthem by Ramabhaktas is also given below—</p>
<p>रघुपति राघव राजा राम पतितपावन सीताराम।<br>
सुंदर माधव मेघश्याम गगातुलसी सालिग्राम॥</p>
<p>The following is one of the Gujarati stanzas added by me—</p>
<p>सारीबुद्धि आपो राम कष्ट हमारा कापो राम।<br>
भक्तिमुक्तिना दायक राम भवसागरना तारक राम॥</p>
<p>The following Hindi is sung by my child Sundarkrishna—</p>
<p>जयरघुनदन जयसिया राम जानकी वल्लभ सीता राम।</p>
<p>Here is the most made-easy stanza of Rama generally carried in placards and published by a large number of people—</p>
<p>राम राम हरे राम, राम राम हरे हरे।<br>
कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण, कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे।</p>
<p>This stanza is sometimes written on blackboard with Ramakhadı (<strong>रामखडी</strong> Ben) a superior kind of chalk for making an impression on the minds of both young and old.</p>
<p>Remember that you are bound to be carried. away in Ramadoli (<strong>रामडोलि</strong> Guj ) or Rama palan—</p>
<p>quin when you become forcibly Ramasaran (<strong>रामशरण</strong> Guj) i.e., meeting with death, by giving up all your wealth, cars, chariots, elephants, horses and lands and note that the only person that will accompany you is Rama and none else Ramabandhu is the only Bandhu that will follow you and the rest of the Bandhus though blood relatives will stop away at a distance and be of no help to your soul Your kinsmen and friends can only create a Rampage (<strong>राम्पेज्</strong> Eng) meaning a wild commotion and that too for a while and soon after your body is burnt or burried, they begin to forget you and you are gradually totally forgotten Sri Sankaracharya has appropriately said the following stanza which I give hereunder with slight modification for the best consideration of my readers having regard to the fleeting nature of Samsara</p>
<p>किवानेन धनेन वाजिकरिभि प्राप्तेन राज्येन कि<br>
किवा पुत्र कलत्र मित्र पशुभिर्देहेन गेहेन किम्।<br>
ज्ञात्वैतत्क्षणभङ्गुर सपदिरेत्याज्यं मनोदूरत<br>
स्वात्मार्थ गुरुवाक्यतो भजभज श्रीजानकी (पार्वती) वल्लभम्॥</p>
<p>In view of the fact that great importance is attached to the word Rama and being connected with ever so many things including the last Carrier better if possible to use Rambans bamboos (<strong>रांबांस</strong></p>
<p>Hindi.) and ropes made of Ramasanda (<strong>रामसंडा</strong> Hin) grass to be in coherence with the Ramadoli, even in regard to Vaikuntha Yatra</p>
<p>One has to bear in mind the impermanence of the world with all its paraphernalia, wealth and power, the fleeting nature of life and the degrading influences of senses and also a numberless unforeseen miseries and troubles that beset the life of any man from cradle to grave. One is sure to be disgusted when he comes across with the vexatious disappointments of life with surprising constant breaches of promises and trusts by the worldly minded friends and relations Undoubtedly there are two stupidities attached to the general biain common to men who are fallen into the pit of Maya with its peculiar misleading attractions and attachments and secondly the idea of enjoying longevity of life in spite of crippled conditions.</p>
<p>It is surprising to see the people pursuing their submission to the influence of the infatuations of the illusory and ill-directing Maya that reduces any able man even into an idiotic position. It is indeed a great wonder that in spite of being cheated by an untrustworthy wife and unworthy sons, fraudulent priests and faithless servants, the man</p>
<p>gets entangled again and again in the whirligig, and the disappointments become all the more keener, while ingratitude takes the place of gratefulness, uncharitable treatment is substituted for kindness, heartless insinuations are returned for sympathetic considerations and Adharma plays an active part for religion in view of the modern changes goingon These damnable qualities can be attributed only to the devilish Kalas (<strong>कला—</strong> arts) of the demoniac Khalas (**खला—**wicked) and their Chhalas (**छला—**deceptions) which are the Balas (**बला—**Pests) due to the Kalı of the 20th century that throws you in the tangle of annoyances In spite of butcherical treatments and deadly defeats of hopes, people dance at the inconceivable Mayavic influences without being able to realize the exact point of truth</p>
<p>Under these circumstances we cannot do better than to surrender to God&rsquo;s will as it is no use depending upon our wills Even the wills though reduced in writings and executed in stamp papers and registered by consulting special law books on Wills cannot be depended upon as they are only subjected to disputes in the refined law courts and ultimately dwindled down and hardly acted upon We are therefore bound to submit to the proverb &ldquo;Man proposes God disposes&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the greatest wonders of our existence also consists in our not being able to know where we were and where we are when we are fast asleep The sleep is said to be the brother of death as stated in Koran We must know that the body granted to us by God is only an instrument for doing good work and obtaining salvation as per the Sanskrit saying</p>
<p>धर्मार्थकाममोक्षाणा भजन मानुष वपु।</p>
<p>It is not only the vessel or utensil to be made use of for the four important requisites of life but also utilised as the vessel the boat for crossing the ocean of Samsara A Gujarati song given below will point out the advisability of offering prayers to Sita Rama and uttering the names of Rama and Krishna and to take advantage of the opportunity afforded to men, possesing the high human life instead of having been shelved into any animal life It clearly indicates as to how the man slowly but surely loses his life every minute and second after second at the same time pointing out as to the death god seated in the body gradually eating away the body and the life and unnoticeably causing your death without fail.</p>
<p>सीता रामने भजीने ल्हावो लीजियेरे, मुखे राम कृष्ण राम कृष्ण कीजियेरे (सीता)<br>
तारो अवसर पल पल जायछेरे, ताराघटमा बेठोने काल खाय छेरे (सीता)</p>
<p>After gaining all experience of the futility of the world our people thought it best to do the best that lie in their power in the present worst times of Kali by taking to the name of Rama throughout the life and at the end thereof Having realized the truth contained in the word Rama and the efficacy thereof, they deemed it fit to repeat the sentence <strong>रामनाम सत्यहे</strong>even at the time of death while carrying the bodies to the grave indicating that Rama&rsquo;s name is the only Truth and this idea is quite in consonance with the statement found inTarasaropanishad <strong>(तारसारोपनिषद्)</strong> under the heading of <strong>रामस्यसर्वात्मकत्वम्</strong> and it runs thus</p>
<p>इदं सत्यमिदं सत्यं सत्यमेतदिहोच्यते।<br>
रामस्सत्य पर ब्रह्म रामात् किञ्चिन विद्यते॥</p>
<p>Taking into consideration that to think of Rama, to utter the name of Rama, including those twisted names of Rama together with the shades of the word Rama in varieties of ways,</p>
<p>and to know closely of Him,and to gain only His favour is the only bestthing, I could do, I allowed my mind to be saturated with the Ramic names and I got into the strain of Ramadhoon (<strong>रामधुन</strong> Guj) and completed the above compilation of this special treatise with all Ramish (<strong>रामिष्</strong>Per) cheerfulness The modern Civilised people generally take to the hobbies of making collections of several kinds of curiosities such as stamps, ancient coins, rare precious stones, books, manuscripts, and so forth, whereas myself having already dealt with the above items exhaustively now entered into the field of making the collection of Ramic names for the benefit of God&rsquo;s servants and Ramis (<strong>रामी</strong> the lovers) of Rama and I hope Rama will be pleased with my humble work and give me at least a small space of the size of a millimetre in His rosy lotusy feet</p>
<p>As regards the names of Rama, I wish to point out that we have a regular Vrata called <strong>राम नाम ग्रहण व्रतम्,</strong> in which one makes the Sankalpa as, <strong>मम एतज्जन्म जन्मान्तरार्जित सकलदुरितोपशम पूर्वक, अक्षय्य विष्णु लोक निवास सिध्यर्थ श्रीराम नामोच्चारण रूप व्रतं करिष्ये।</strong> This Vrata is observed for a period of 12 years</p>
<p>Besides Rama Navami Vratam and Rama Nama Vratam we have also Rama Nama Lekhana Vratam viz, writing of Rama&rsquo;s names as already</p>
<p>stated in this book page 181 for which there is also the Udyapanam prescribed and the story relating thereto given</p>
<p>People desirous to obtain salvation are expected to perform Rama Navami Vratam as stated in Skanda Purana :—</p>
<p>मुमुक्षुश्च सदाकुर्यात् श्रीराम नवमी व्रतम्।<br>
मुच्यते सर्वपापेभ्यो याति ब्रह्म सनातनम्॥</p>
<p>It will be interesting to find that Rama&rsquo;s name is given in charity to Brahmins besides pictures and idols</p>
<p>I thought I will be worrying my Rama, with this subject concerning innumerable names, but thinking again that He is all in all active, all in all energetic, all in all inspiring, all in all strong, all in all working, all in all pervading, all in all moving and all in all playing Rama, and ever possessing these qualities He will not feel tiresome, I have indulged in this Ramanamic subject I recommend my readers that in addition to the Rama Sahasranamas they will also do well to perform Archana with the Rama Sahasranama arranged in alphabetical order (Vide Pooja Samuchchaya published in Bombay page 131) and enjoy the pleasant thought of worship combined with innocence, peace, purity</p>
<p>and duty I also recommend that Sri Rama&rsquo;s<strong>मत्र संपुटित अष्टोत्तरशत</strong> <strong>नामार्चन</strong> may be performed, of which one instance is given below—</p>
<p>ॐ श्रीमद् ब्रह्मेंद्ररुद्रादि वदनीय जगद्गुरवे नमः।</p>
<p>One may also perform Seeta <strong>अष्टोत्तरशतनामार्चन</strong> found in Ananda Ramayana and the Sita Sahasranama mentioned by Valmeeki in Adbhutottara Ramayana</p>
<p>As regards writing of Rama Namas it is stated in Shastras as follows—</p>
<p>राम नाम लिखेद्यस्तु लक्षकोटि शतावधिॆ।<br>
एकैक मक्षर पुसा महापातक नाशनम्॥</p>
<p>Note that presents of Ramanamangulıyaka <strong>(रामनामाङ्गुलीयक</strong>) rings are also given</p>
<p>The value of Rama Nama—</p>
<p>अश्वमेध सहस्त्राणि वाजपेय शतानि च।<br>
एकेन रामनाम्ना तु तत्फल लभते नर॥</p>
<p>My readers will be astonished to see me repeating the same subject of RamaNama again and again having in a way closed it It looks to me that it is very difficult to conclude this chapter being the subject matter of Rama, who always</p>
<p>is found to be playing in some form or other in the universe and secondly, the subject is one with which one should not be disgusted, especially when we bring to our recollection regarding the statement made by Parvatı saying that She is not contented by drinking the nectar of Ramarasayana—</p>
<p>त्वन्मुखाद्गलितराम तत्वामृत रसायनम्।<br>
पिबतो मे मनो देव न तृप्यति भवापहम्॥</p>
<p>Thirdly, it is The Thing that one has to be ever seeking after, to be pure and virtuous and derive happiness It is the best thought to be entertained in the mind—a thought far superior to the thoughts suggested to be encouraged by way of remembrances in Christmas and New Year cards regarding friends, loves and lovers with all attractions in the fancy cards Comparatively the thought of God has to be entertained and kept ever green in the minds of men. Thus it will be seen that no question arises as to why it is repeated by whomsoever it may be Our heterodox friends realize the value of God, His name, its repetition and offerings made to Him when they are found in the troublous turmoils being tremendously afraid of Him at the critical juncture. When Goddess Parvati, the wife of that</p>
<p>great Siva expreses that She has not been content with the Rama&rsquo;s names and has to continue the repetition further, it is no wonder that a particle of. a dust-like my humblest of humbleself to feel it a disgust in repeatedly thinking or speaking on the name of Rama which is sweeter in sound than the musical repeaters, contained in watches, clocks bells etc See the following—</p>
<p>श्री राम नाम सदृश मवशे चापि सगृणन्।<br>
मुक्ति प्राप्नोति मनुज कि पुनर्बुद्धि पूर्वकम्॥</p>
<p>The following is the confirmation of which I have already mentioned in this book—</p>
<p>रा शब्दोच्चारणे जाते वक्तात्पापस्यनिर्गम।<br>
मकार श्रवणे जाते भस्मीभाव गमिष्यति॥</p>
<p>It is said that even Srutis acknowledge as follows—</p>
<p>कोटि यज्ञ समो राम चन्द्रभद्रेत्यय मनु।<br>
नमोन्त श्रुतिभि प्रोत्तो वेदान्तेषु यथाक्रमम्॥</p>
<p>The constant and continued utterance of Ramanama is justified by the following stanza given in Ramotsava Ratnakara—</p>
<p>गच्छन्स्तिष्ठन् श्वसन् नृत्यन् भुञ्जानो वापि मानव।<br>
मुच्यते रघुनाथस्य कीर्तनान्नान्यतो द्विज॥</p>
<p>Even those including the several high class Brahmins, comprising hatwalas and batwalas (criketeer), heatwalas (hot tempered) and meatwalas, hootwalas (hooting out anybody) and bootwalas, coatwalas and boatwalas, (always travelling in sea) that mock at religion and God—should think for a moment that when they are found dead, their corpses are removed by uttering the name of Rama. Look at this contrast!</p>
<p>The other wonder is that even after becoming Christians, distinctions are made between Brahmin Christians and Non-Brahmin Christians and Poojas of Rama, Ganesha, etc, are performed by the converts. Maintaining Hinduism after becoming Christians This wisdom is marvellous and one has to enquire as to in which bazaar it is sold!</p>
<p>It is further wonderful to observe the inconsistency prevailing in every Brahmin being addressed as Maharaj A Brahmin cook is called a Maharaj, a Paricharaka, a Brahmin tailor, a Brahmin Mithaiwala, and even uneducated Dhore like Gore that would have never performed Sandhya in his life time expect to be called as Maharaj Even Mama professionals desire to be addressed as such!</p>
<p>If People give up their &ldquo;Pride&rdquo;, which is their chief ideal of life and their ideas of &ldquo;Dont care for devotional duty in the face of the worldly &ldquo;The duty&rdquo;,— encouraged by the thought that Truth lies only in worldly pleasures denying the existence of a Ruler, as observed by Prof Max Muller in his translation of Bhagavad Gita, p 115&rdquo; and give up their insatiated desires, vanity and ostentatiousness being engaged in unholy observances— all in delusion— they will certainly realize the value of devotion and will think of the name of God which is the most essential part of man&rsquo;s duty</p>
<p>See what God says in Gita chap 16, Slo 18. regarding those that disregard Him—</p>
<p>अहकार बल दर्पं काम क्रोध च संश्रिताः।<br>
मामात्मपरदेहेषु प्रद्विषन्तोऽभ्यसूयका॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those that have got aversion for Me I fling them into demoniac wombs and impel them to commit ferocious actions&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cleverness of some of the demoniac men has to be fully depreciated when we take their perverse intellgence in creating a deep interest in the minds of people to find a way to destroy themselves and their own properties Though destruction after destruction is caused and the loss</p>
<p>of wealth 1S clearly noticed, troubles fully experienced, hurled into dishonour and disrepute, still these Karmarakshasas and Brahmarakshasas or even Charmaral shasas, who do not understand the Marma of Dhar a whether they are Varmas, Sharmas or others would not pity the sufferers, but continue their game of instigation for maintaining mischievous and litigeous practice &ldquo;To obtain heaps of wealth unfairly for enjoying (their) objects of desires&rdquo; as stated by Pro Max-Muller</p>
<p>They are really pests that appear as best friends without allowing you to rest, but keep you always in unrest One cannot test at first until gets grief in his chest with all disgust These sinners are actually treated as guests by the poor deluded youngsters that get into their nests wearing a vest with some false ideas of the west and this continues until everything is converted into jest</p>
<p>Somehow or other owing to misdirected, and irreligious education such devilish work of Rakshasic Maya is considered as befitting to their illbred upstartic disposition and ill intentioned mentality whatever may be the degree of education received Sri Rama, Sita, Vibhishana and others have already narrated a good deal for practicing high ideals of noble life and given extremely valuable advice to mankind in that great epic</p>
<p>Ramayana, the book of the highest civilization of Hindus</p>
<p>Even such persons that have given up ablutions, prayers Karmas etc, can take at least to Ramanama they will be doing some Dharmic duty as will be found in the following stanza—</p>
<p>औपासने न रहिता पञ्चयज्ञ पराङ्मुखा।<br>
सन्ध्यावन्दन हीनाश्च शुद्धा रामस्य कीर्तनात्॥</p>
<p>Further—</p>
<p>सदासकृद्वारामेति जपन् भक्त्या प्रसन्नधी।<br>
सर्वपापविशुद्धात्मा सकल भद्रमश्नुते॥</p>
<p>The merciful God is still inclined to help even those that have taken to make fun and frolic with God&rsquo;s names in their gossips with the attacks of non-senses by the survey of their own sense with their brains that would not receive the duty of religious ideas owing to the enlargement of their livers To such so called gental men possesing the mental fabric of calculating interest and rentals and engaged with dental surgeons the following quotation will be suitable—</p>
<p>मुक्तो मुमुक्षवो बद्धा स्त्रिविधा जीवराशय।<br>
परिहासेनया भक्त्या सल्लापाद्धेलनेनवा।<br>
स्मरन् रामेति सतत जीवन्मुक्ता न सशय॥</p>
<p>Suta says as pointed out in Ramotsavaratnakara—</p>
<p>भक्तिर्मुक्ति विधायिनी भगवत श्रीरामचन्द्रस्य हे<br>
लोका कामदुघाङ्घ्रिपद्मयुगल सेवध्यमभ्युत्सुका।<br>
नाना ज्ञान विशेषमन्त्र वितर्ति त्यक्त्वा सुद्रे भृश<br>
रामं श्यामतनु स्मरारि हृदये भान्त भजध्व बुधा॥</p>
<p>Regarding the virtue of the bestowal of thought on Rama I hereunder give the following Telugu verse—</p>
<p>ఉరుసంసారపయోనిధి తరణంబలు బాప పుంజ దరణంబులు శ్రీ<br>
కరణంబులుముక్తి సమా, చరణంబులు రామనామసుస్మరణంబుక్</p>
<p>Always attempt to procure the Ramikh (<strong>रामिक्</strong> Ara) of Rama viz., his glance, as everything depends upon Ramakataksha—the charm of Hislook In this connection the following quotation from Valmeeki will be worth noting—</p>
<p>यश्च राम नपश्येत्तु यच राम न पश्यति।<br>
निन्दितस्य पुमान् लोकेस्वात्माप्येन निगर्हते॥</p>
<p>Doing Ramakaj <strong>(रामकाज)</strong> or Ramakarya <strong>(रामकार्य)</strong> or Ramakainkarya <strong>(रामकैंकर्य)</strong> is our duty towards the Ramani Rama <strong>(रमणी)</strong> the beautiful Rama, the Ramano Rama (<strong>रमणो</strong>Pal) the playing Rama, the Ramaniyo Rama (<strong>रमणीयो</strong> Pal) the charming Rama, the Ramaniyako Rama (<strong>रमणीयको</strong></p>
<p>Pal) the pleasant Rama, the Ramih Rama (<strong>रामिह</strong>— Ara ) the armed Rama and the Rami <strong>रामी</strong> (Arabic</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Additional Ramayans</strong></p>
<p>I give the following information available in Gujarati veises for those interested in Ramayanas besides the several names of Ramayanas mentioned by me in page 168 of this book—</p>
<p>वाल्मीकिरामायण प्रथम वली, व्यासे रामायण करी।<br>

<p>and Persian) the Archer Rama and who is auspicious Ramabhadra <strong>(रामभद्र)</strong> the moon-like Ramachandra <strong>(रामचन्द्र)</strong> the gem-like Ramaratna <strong>(रामरत्न)</strong>, the Lord of the world Ramanatha <strong>(रामनाथ)</strong> and the domineer of Lakshmi the Rama Ramana <strong>(रमा रमणा)</strong></p>
<p>To such Rama properly propitiate, profoundly piaise, pressingly pray, promptly prostrate, promulgate his preternatural prowess as He is the proverbial Paramatma, Pranajeevana and Prasannatma and prominently prosper Benediction and invocation will obtain approbation and secure protection at the hands of Sri Rama</p>
<p>Trust fully in The Full, the joyful, the beautiful, the merciful, the boonful, the powerful, the delightful, the blissful and the allful Rama who will make us thoughtful and give us plentiful and fulfil our desires</p>
<p>I thus conclude this chapter by expressing the following stanzas on Rama as the all-round Rama.</p>
<p>रामाभिराम नयनाभिराम लोकाभिराम सुगुणाभिरामम्।<br>
सर्वाभिराम च सदाभि राम वन्दे सदानद मनोभि रामम्॥</p>

<p><strong>The Description of Rama—The Delight of the World</strong></p>
<p>From old Ikshvaku&rsquo;s line He came<br>
Known to the world by Rama&rsquo;s name<br>
With soul subdued, a chief of might,<br>
In scripture versed, in glory bright<br>
His steps in virtues paths are bent,<br>
Simple, pure and eloquent<br>
In each emprise he wins success,<br>
And dying foes his power confess<br>
His mighty shafts he truly aims,<br>
And foemen in the battle tames<br>
His lordly steps are firm and free,<br>
His strong arms reach below his knee<br>
All fairest graces join to deck,<br>
His head, his brow, his stately neck,<br>
His plighted word he never forgets,<br>
On erring sense a watch he sets</p>
<p>Good, resolute and pure, and strong,<br>
He guards mankind from scathy and wrong,<br>
And lends his aid and never in vain,<br>
The cause of justice to maintain<br>
The noblest of lordly givers,<br>
Whom good men follow, as the rivers,<br>
The pear of Vishnu&rsquo;s power and might,<br>
And lovely as the lord of Night<br>
Patient as Earth, but roused to ire,<br>
Fierce as the world destroying fire,<br>
In bounty like the Lord of Gold,<br>
And Justice self in human mould</p>
<p><strong>Rama&rsquo;s Boyhood and His Marvellous Anecdotes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>बालक्रीडा</strong> of <strong>बालराम।</strong></p>
<p>निराकार निर्गुण प्रभु, तदपि सगुण धरदेह।<br>
करत रहत नाना चरित, केवल भक्त सनेह॥</p>
<p>(1) Child as He was, of course decked with splendid garments, and ornaments set with effulgent precious stones in addition to His being the natural beauty of beauties, and as the descent (Avatar) of God, Rama had also worn a neck ornament containing lion&rsquo;s and tiger&rsquo;s nails, which are said to ward off evil eyes On the chest of the child the mark of the foot of Bhrigu Maharishi</p>
<p>called Bhugu Lanchhan was also noticedSee the Marathi Dindi <strong>दिण्डि</strong> fare given below—</p>
<p>तवचरणाची मुद्राहृदयी धारणकरिता भूषणहोयी।<br>
यास्तंव सदया आज्ञाद्यावी धारण करण्याला॥</p>
<p>Interested as we are in Rama, let us observe as to some of His miraculous deeds, during his childhood</p>
<p>(2) The child that can make the whole world to play and even make dance, with the movements of His eye brows was found playing in the arms of the mother Kausalya One day He wanted a monkey for His play A number of monkeys were brought, but He did not like them Vasishtha, however, informed King Dasarathha that a particular monkey should be sent for from Sugriva, whereupon messenger was sent to Kishkindha, and the monkey was brought, who was approved by Rama and who was always found playing with Him</p>
<p>(3) The Boy Rama was very fond of playing kites and on a certain day, He prepared an exquisitely grand kite and made it fly, fly and fly so much so that it went higher, higher and higher, passing one region after another and reached fight up to Indra Loka Seeing the charming kite with</p>
<p>a number of decorations Jayantithe wife of Indra&rsquo;s son held up the kite and retained the same with her Knowing this the Boy Rama directed His mighty monkey companion, the powerful son of the wind-god who flew with marvellous velocity brought back the kite and handed over to Sri Rama</p>
<p>(4) Once upon a time certain merchants brought jewels and the Young Rama took away one of them and threw it into a well He was asked to get the same back, when Rama said, go and take it Servants got down in the well, and there was seen a tree grown containing several branches, each branch having bunches of jewels of the same type This created a great wonder in the city and people thronged in large numbers and took away jewels after jewels and were found immensely pleased</p>
<p>(5) On another occasion certain hunter brought some birds for sale and the Boy Rama caught hold of them and allowed them to fly away and on the hunter complaining this to the parents, two pieces of feathers which were in the hands of Rama were burried in the sand and some water was sprinkled over it, with the result that a plant had grown and bore fruits from which hundreds of</p>
<p>birds began to fly making tremendous noise with sweet notes being heard throughout the city</p>
<p>(6) A lion had caught a cow and Rama killed him with His arrow and immediately the lion became a Gandharva, assuming his former life</p>
<p>(7) A swine was found rushing against Rama, who was struck by the Little Rama and was killed in a moment Immediately, the swine presented in the form of certain hing, who was born as a swine, on account of his conduct of showing disrespect to elders</p>
<p>(8) While Rama was taking His bath in the Sarayu river in company with a number of playmates, a big crocodile swallowed Him, at the instigation of Ravana, but the Little Folk Rama immediately slew the huge crocodile and came out by tearing its belly to the surprise of all that witnessed the incident</p>
<p>(9) When Rama was playing on the bank of the River Sarayu, Ravana came in the form of a large bird with the intention of carrying Him away which Rama at once understood and hit with His bow without any arrow and Ravana was thrown away at a very long distance and for 7 days he was unconcious and he was very much ashamed after regaining his consciousness</p>
<p>(10) As a Baby He was found playing in the cradle and when Kausalya went to offer Naivedyam to the family deity Lakshmi Narayana, Rama was found eating the Naivedyam and when she got alarmed and came back in search of the Baby Rama, she found it in the cradle, which created a great puzzle in the mind of Kausalya</p>
<p>Sri Rama had made it a rule of daily prostrating before His mother and father Dasaratha every morning as stated below—</p>
<p>प्रात काल उठिकै रघुनाथा, मातुपिता गुरुनावहि माथा॥</p>
<p>As regards His various activities of killing a large number of Rakshasas in His blooming youth which formed the chief part of Ramayana is known to all as mentioned below—</p>
<p>राक्षसाना वधार्थाय दैत्याना निधनायच।<br>
परित्राणाय साधूना जातोराम स्वय हरि॥</p>
<p>The only one incident require to be pointed out is as to how Rama appeared in hundreds and thousands of similar forms at one and the same time in different places and simultaneously accorded interview to a large number of people who were anxious to pay their respects personally to Him, when He returned to Ayodhya, which is one of His miraculous deeds</p>

<p>I now give an English Prayer on Rama</p>
<p>Suited to all the fashions of the day<br>
English being liked in every way<br>
What is in language for really to pray<br>
Be true to your religion and hail with jay ( जय) LG</p>
<p><strong>English Rama Stotra.</strong></p>
<p>Thou art the Lord Narayan, thou<br>
The God to whom all creatures bow,<br>
Thou art the saviour God who wore<br>
Of old the semblance of a hoar,<br>
Thou he whose Discus overthrows (चक्र)<br>
All present, past and future foes,<br>
Thou Brahman, That whose days extend<br>
Without beginning, growth or end,<br>
The God, who, bears the bow of horn,<br>
Whom four majestic arms adorn, (चतुर्भुज)<br>
Thou art the God who rules the sense<br>
And sways with gentle influence,<br>
Thou all pervading Vishnu Lord<br>
Who wears the ever-conquering sword,<br>
Thou art the Guide who leads aright,<br>
Thou Krishna of unequalled might,<br>
Thy hand, O Lord, the hills and plains,<br>
And earth with all her life sustains,<br>
Thou wilt appear in serpent form (आदिशेष)<br>
When sinks the earth in fire and storm<br>
Queen Sita of the lovely brows<br>
Is Lakshmi thy celestial spouse<br>
High bliss awaits the devotee<br>
Who clings in loving faith to thee,<br>
Who celebrates with solemn praise<br>
The Lord of Ne&rsquo;er beginning days, (अनादि)<br>
On earth below, in heaven above<br>
Great joy shall crown his faith and love</p>
<p>फलश्रुति।</p>
<p>Blessings will attend to the person, whether man or woman that reads or hears the above Stotra He who reads the above Stotra will be absolved from all his or her sins, and he or she shall obtain all health, wealth and strength and his or her desires will be amply fulfilled</p>

And stayed within the hermit grove<br>
The chariot and the steeds he drove<br>
With gens, and Rama&rsquo;s queen were placed,<br>
All faim Ayodhya to behold<br>
An elephant of hugest frame,<br>
Nine thousand others bore, behind,<br>
The chieftains of the Vanar kınd<br>
All gay, in forms of human mould,<br>
With rich attire and gems and gold<br>
Thus borne along in royal state<br>
King Rama reached Ayodhya&rsquo;s gate<br>
With merry noise of shells and drums<br>
And joyful shouts, he comes, he comes,</p>
<p>And happy maids in ordered bands<br>
Threw grain and gold with liberal hands<br>
Neath gorgeous flags that waved in rows,<br>
On towers and 100fs and porticoes<br>

<p><strong>Description of Rama&rsquo;s Coronation</strong></p>
<p>Then girt by many a Brahman sage,<br>
Vasishtha, chief for reverend age,<br>
High on a throne with jewels graced<br>
King Rama and his Sita placed<br>
Thereby Jabalı far revered<br>
Vijaya and Kasyapa&rsquo;s son appeared,<br>
By Gautam&rsquo;s side Katyayan stood,<br>
And Vamadeva wise and good,<br>
Whose holy hands in order shed<br>
The pure sweet drops on Rama&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>Then priests and maids and warriors, a॥<br>
Approaching at Vasishtha&rsquo;s call,<br>
With sacred drops bedewed their king,<br>
The centre of a joyous ring,<br>
The guardians of the worlds on high,<br>
And all the children of the sky<br>
From herbs wherewith their hands were filled<br>
Rare juices on his brow distilled<br>
His brows were bound with glittering gold<br>
Which Manu&rsquo;s self had worn of old,<br>
Bright with the flash of many a gem,<br>
His sire&rsquo;s ancestral diadem<br>
Satrughna lent his willing aid<br>
And o er him held the regal shade,<br>
The monarchs whom his arm had saved<br>
The chouries round him forehead waved<br>
A golden chain, that flashed and glowed<br>
With gems the God of Wind bestowed,<br>
Mahendra gave a glorious string<br>
Of fairest pearls to deck the king,<br>
The skies with acclamation rang,<br>
The gay nymphs danced, the minstrels sang<br>
The trees the witching influence knew,<br>
And bent with fruits of loveliest hue,<br>
And Rama&rsquo;s consecration lent<br>
New sweetness to each flowret&rsquo;s scent,<br>
The monarch joy of Raghus line<br>
Gave largest to the Brahmans, kind<br>
And steeds unnumbered, wealth untold<br>
Of robes and pearls and gems and gold</p>
<p>A jewelled chain, whose lusture passed<br>
The glory of the sun, he cast<br>
About his friend Sugrivas nech<br>
And, Angada Vali&rsquo;s son to deck,<br>
He gave a pair of armlets bright<br>
With diamond and lazulite<br>
A string of pearls of matchless hue<br>
Which gleams like tender moonlight threw<br>
Adorned with gems of brightest sheen,<br>
He gave to grace his darling Queen<br>
The offering from his hand received<br>
A moment on her bosom heaved,<br>
Then from her neck the chain she drew,<br>
A glance on all the Vanars threw<br>
And wistful eyes on Rama bent<br>
As still she held the ornament<br>
Her wish he knew, and made reply<br>
To that mute question on her eye<br>
Yea, love, the chain on his bestow<br>
Whose wisdom truth and might we know<br>
The firm ally, the faithful friend<br>
Through toil and peril to the end<br>
Then on Hanuman&rsquo;s bosom hung<br>
The chain which Sita&rsquo;s hand had flung<br>
To every Vanar Rama gave<br>
Rich treasures from the mine and wave<br>
And with their honours well content<br>
Homeward their steps the chieftains bent.<br>
Ten thousand years Ayodhya, blest<br>
With Rama&rsquo;s rule, and peace and rest</p>

<p>We know, that not an iota moves without His pleasure and that the God of death is entirely under the control of that God of Gods, which is established by the following verse:—</p>
<p>काल कालयतेकाले मृत्योर्मृत्युर्भयोभयम्।<br>
वेदान्तवेद्यो भगवान्यत्तच्छब्दोपलक्षित॥</p>
<p>Almighty God is the propeller of time He is the death of death, fear of fear and knowable through Vedanta-denoted by the word <strong>तत्</strong>(That)</p>
<p>यद्भयाद्वाति वातोपि सूर्यस्तपति यद्भयात्।<br>

<p>Note what Yama or Israel directs his messengers as follows—</p>

परिहरमधुसूदन प्रपन्नान् प्रभुरहमन्यनृणा न वैष्णवानाम्॥</p>
<p>He quietly tells in their ears and orders them not to approach Vaishnavas (meaning the devotees of the all pervading God), by sending for his emissaries holding nooses in their hands</p>
<p>सुरमन्दिरतरुमूलनिवासः शय्याभूतलमजिनं वासः।<br>

<p>By renunciation a man lives under the tree of a holy temple, goes to sleep on the ground, wears a deer&rsquo;s skin for cloth and sacrifices all comforts by giving up enjoyments of life Whom shall not such renunciation or Vairagya make happy     (44)</p>
<p>Pray to Lord Govinda<br>
Prav to Lord Govinda Pray to Lord Govinda<br>
Oh Ignorant and foolish-minded man</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>*Note what Gita says—</p>
<p><strong>विविक्तसेवी लघ्वाशी यतवाक्काय मानस।<br>
ध्यानयोगपरोनित्य वैराग्य समुपाश्रित॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>अहकार बल दर्प काम क्रोध परिग्रहम्।<br>
विमुच्य निर्मम शातो ब्रह्म भूयायकल्पते॥</strong><br>
**                     ** (Bha Gita Chap 18 Slo 52 &amp; 53 )</p>
<p>Living on light diet, living in solitude and having controlled the body, the speech and mind, after giving up ego, power, pride, lust, wrath and freed from my-ness and self-love and taken to patience and renunciation, one eagerly devotes himself to the meditation of God, enjoys undisturbed thorough peace and becomes competent to attain Brahman.</p>
<p>Vairagya is a fundamental requisite for directing the sole attention to study the life, the God and their relation concerning Sat, Chit and Ananda Without discarding numerous worldly matters one cannot engross himself in the thought of the most difficult discovery of seeking after God, as it is otherwise a mental impossibility The ideal of Janaka is too high to be followed</p>
<p>Several persons taken to priesthood open a shop of a particular kind of init ation for the realisation of God, Truth or Sayujya on the pertinent ground that tons of theories will not be equal to an ounce of realisation They express that practice of Yoga is not required for married men, themselves being merged in married life with wives and children This seems to be one of the curiosities of the present century If these priests have themselves realised the knowledge of God and Truth and make themselves so practical as to bring God near at hand, and the Sayujya, Sirupya, Sameepy a or Salohya at their beck and call, where is the necessity for them to be dipped in family and to continue Samsaric life&rsquo; It surnasses one&rsquo;s highly devoted mind and particularly such a state of mind of such being who has practically realised the God to be still subjected to the attachments and attractions of family ties which must necessarily have their agonies Of course some of the educated men being desirous of getting into some knowledge anxiously subject themselves to be initiated in the hope of realising the practical truth at least by degrees which is one of the forms of infatuation Ofcourse a better employment for the mind It is really a mystery Fancy, how these degrees of realisation can be gauged even though some priests are able to invent a realiza meter It is an admitted fact that highly pitched things can be achieved by means of enormous all round knowledge with a good deal of culture and experience or by the miraculous grace conferred by the Lord of Lords One has to bear in mind the innumerable reservations of the most powerful Almighty which cannot be seen or thought of by the best of sights and the best of intelligence It must be remembered that one has to study the details of intelligence combined with wisdom supported by the highly developed</p>
<p>and cultured mind with its sub divisions known as Manas, Buddhi, Chitta, Ahankara and Antahkarana It must be noted that spiritual disection work of Atma, Raramata, Jeevatma has engaged the attention of so many sophers belonging to different schools Undoubtedly some conclusion has to be arrived at by making a comparative observation of this finest of fine subjects which do not give any clue to the best scientists of the day Note what Gita says—</p>
<p><strong>आश्चर्यवत्पश्यति कश्चिदेनमाश्चर्यवदतितथैव चान्यः।<br>
आश्चर्यवश्चैनमन्य शृणोति श्रुत्वाप्येन वेदन चैवकश्चित्॥</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;One looketh on this (Atma) as wonderful, similarly some one else speaketh of it in wonderment, another heareth about it as wonderful but no one knoweth at all what it is&rsquo;</p>
<p>The supreme happiness of Vairagya has been described by Bartriharı as follows—</p>
<p><strong>भोगे रोगभय कुलेच्युतिभय वित्तेनृपालाद्भय<br>
माने दैन्यभयं बले रिपुभय रूपे जरायाभयम्।<br>
शास्त्रवादिभयं गुणे खलभयं काये कृतान्ताद्भय<br>
सर्व वस्तु भयान्वित भुविनृणा वैराग्यमेवाभयम्॥</strong></p>
<p>At least try to lead a simple life in accordance with the&rsquo; &ldquo;Plain living and High thinking&rsquo; without the materialistic selfish notion of &ldquo;High living and Low thinking&rdquo;, being always merged in selfishly eating, selfishly drinking, self-praising, self-conceipt and self-aggrandisement without realising the value of self-control and self-denial, i.eselflessness and the value of Vairagya</p>
