  <meta property="og:description" content="INTRODUCTION I THE POET. HIS LIFE AND WORKS. At the outset it must be admitted that we have absolutely no trustworthy information regarding the personal history of Kâlidása, the brightest jewel of the mine of Indian poets. The curiosity of the querist who would ask-Where and when was he born’? Who were his parents’? When did he die ? &amp;c.’-must ever reamin unsatisfied. The poet has studiously observed utter silence about himself in his works. Read them howsoever we may, we find no allusion, no incident mentioned that may directly shed any light either on his person or any remarkable event of his life. In the words of Hazlitt ‘he was the least of an egotist that it was possible to be.’ His poetical productions alone stand as an immortal monument of his surpassing poetic excellence. And we must content ourselves with gathering what little information we can about a post of such world-wide repute from external sources and a few incidents found here and there in his works which have a distant bearing upon the history of his life. Reserving for a future section the question about the date of the poet, we proceed here to state the few facts that can thus be known about him. A time-honoured tradition, supported by internal and external evidence, associates the name of Kalidasa with that of the epoch making king, Vikramaditya of Ujjayini, The keen interest and the filial love with which poet in his Meghadûta describes the Mahákåla and Siprá, and the other beauties of Ujjayiní, unmistakably point to the conclusion that he must have been a native of that city.

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>At the outset it must be admitted that we have absolutely no trustworthy information regarding the personal history of Kâlidása, the brightest jewel of the mine of Indian poets. The curiosity of the querist who would ask-Where and when was he born&rsquo;? Who were his parents&rsquo;? When did he die ? &amp;c.&rsquo;-must ever reamin unsatisfied. The poet has studiously observed utter silence about himself in his works. Read them howsoever we may, we find no allusion, no incident mentioned that may directly shed any light either on his person or any remarkable event of his life. In the words of Hazlitt &lsquo;he was the least of an egotist that it was possible to be.&rsquo; His poetical productions alone stand as an immortal monument of his surpassing poetic excellence. And we must content ourselves with gathering what little information we can about a post of such world-wide repute from external sources and a few incidents found here and there in his works which have a distant bearing upon the history of his life. Reserving for a future section the question about the date of the poet, we proceed here to state the few facts that can thus be known about him. A time-honoured tradition, supported by internal and external evidence, associates the name of Kalidasa with that of the epoch making king, Vikramaditya of Ujjayini, The keen interest and the filial love with which poet in his Meghadûta describes the Mahákåla and Siprá, and the other beauties of Ujjayiní, unmistakably point to the conclusion that he must have been a native of that city. And the various covart references to the name of Vikrama in his Vik. in fully eulogistic terms, which are doubtless meant to immor. talize that king, are inexplicable if that monarch be not regarded as the poet&rsquo;s patron. Kálidâsa also botrays considerable acquaintance with court-life in his works. This circumstance coupled with the fact that there is no allusion in his writings to the Goddess of Wealth having ever frowned upon him shows that he was in affluent circumstances and had not the misfor-</p>

tune ever to drink the bitter cup of poverty. He was a Bráhmana by caste and was a devout worshipper of S&rsquo;iva though by no means a sectarian. He seems to have travelled a good deal, at least in Northern India. For, as Dr. Bháu Dáji remarke, he is the only post who describes a living saffron flower, the plant of which grows in Kashmir. Ilis graphic description of the Himalayan scenes in the first and the eighth cantos of the Kumarasambhava looks very much like that of one who was an eye-witness. Unlike Bhavabhâti and many other brotherpoets he appears to have enjoyed great popularity in his lifetime. He was &lsquo;an admirer of field-sports and describes their beneficial effects with the exactness of a true sportsman.&rsquo; Though fond of pleasures he was not the unscrupulous voluptuary he is supposed to be by some critics, as is clear from the many noble sentiments expressed in the Sakuntala ( of. eâqökta qr** &amp;c. S&rsquo;ák, V. and our note ad loc.). It also appears from the same play that he was against love-marriages though always actuated with the most generous sentiments towards the fair sex.
Ilis works bear further testimony to his considerable acquaintance with the Vedas, the philosophy taught by the Upanishads, the Bhagavadgitâ, the Puranas, the systems of the Sakhya, Yoga, and Vedanta, as propounded by Badarayana, medicine and the rudiments of astronomy. Beyond these few facts nothing is known for certain about our post at present. A few conjectures have been advanced as to some other particulare but to test their correctness or otherwise falls within the province of the antiquary.
His Works.
The poet&rsquo;s silence about himself in his works gave opportunity to many unscrupulous inferior poets to father their own works upon him. The following is a list of the works attributed to him:( 1 ) शाकुन्तल, ( 2 ) विक्रमोर्वशीय, ( 3 ) मालविकामिमित्र, ( 4 ) रघुवंश, (5) कुमारसंभव, ( 6 ) मेघदूत (7) कुन्तेश्वरदौत्य, ( 8 ) ऋतुसंहार, ( 9 ) अस्त्रास्तव, ( 10 ) कालीस्तोत्र ( 11 ) काव्यनाटकालंकारा: ( १ ), ( 12 ) घटकर्पर, ( 13 ) चण्डिकादण्डकास्तोत्र ( 14 ) दुर्घटकाव्य, ( 15 ) नलोय, ( 16 ) नवरत्नमाला, ( 17 ) पुष्पबाणविलास, ( 18 ) राक्षसकाव्य, (19) #geaa, (20) fiaftizana, (21) geraamtea, (22) शृङ्गारतिलक, ( 23 ) शृङ्गारसार, ( 24 ) श्यामलादण्डक, ( 25 ) श्रुतबोध, (21) igru. Of these the first six are acknowledged by all critics to be his. (7) is not yet discovered, but is quoted as</li>

Kâlidâsa&rsquo;s by the Kashmirian Scholar Kshemendra in bis Auchityavicháracharchâ. The authorship of (8) is somewhat doubtful; while the rest are certainly to be dismissed as the productions of other poets. Here, therefore, we are concerned with the first six alone. The most convenient and reliable method of studying the development of the poet&rsquo;s mind and its relations to his productions would be to read his works in their chrono“ logical order. But we have no external evidence whatsoever to ascertain the chronology of Kâlidása&rsquo;s works. It must, therfore, be based wholly on internal evidence, Judged as such the works would stand in this order-Foems-TĦITO) मेघदूत and रघुवंश. Plays - माल०, विक्रमो० and शाकुन्तल; or both
Plays-13, . indiscriminately as कुमार, मालविका०, विक्रमो० मेघदूत, शाकुन्तल and g. Space will not permit us even to refer to these briefly. We will only remark in passing that the last three are the outcome of the poet&rsquo;s matured poetic faculties and riper years.
The genius of Kálidása has been recognized and appreciated by the whole of the literary world. It has attracted the scholars and distinguished Orientalists of Europe and America. His poetic genius has brought Sanskrit poetry to the highest refinement consistent with purity and without any extravagant colouring. An unaffected simplicity of expression and an easy-flowing language mark his writings which are embellished with unparalleled similes and general truths. He is universally praised for the beauty of his representations, the tenderness of feeling, and the richness of his imagination. Among Sanskrt writers the earliest reference to him is in the Aihole inscription of Pulakes&rsquo;i 11. (634 A. D.) where Ravikirti is described as having attained the literary glory of Kålidása and Bbáravi. In his introduction to the HarshaCharita Báņa speaks of him in the following words:-
&ldquo;6
farang a ai merr anfèqreer æfing प्रीतिर्मधुरसार्द्रास मअरीष्विव जायते ॥ &quot;
As soon as Kálidása&rsquo;s sweet sayings went forth from him was there any one who did not rejoice in them as in honey-laden flowers? Kumárila, who flourished about the first half of the eighth century, in his Tantravártika, quotes with approval the passage from the S&rsquo; ákuntala&ndash;&rdquo; सतां हि सन्देहपदेषु वस्तुषु प्रमाणमन्तः#yoga:.” The tame and colourless character of the description of our poet as contained in these earlier refernces, would
(4)
naturally lead to the conclusion that his superior merits, as a poet, were not properly appreciated and the literary supremacy that has for upwards of a thousand years been assigned to him was never thought of in those days. And this evidently for the reason that these medieval writers were incapable of appreciating the internal excellence of his poetic genius, his lively imagination and faithful delineation of character, as their own taste was vitiated by an undue fondness for long compounds, double-meaning and obscure words &amp;c.-a fondness which made them sometimes sacrifice sense to the external beauty of words. It was only in later times that intelligent and unbiased minds began to recognize his superior merits and since that the Pandits and especially foreign scholars have been the loudest and most sincere in singing the praises of the immortal bard of Sanskrit Literature, the Shakespeare of India. One Paṇḍit has said—
पुरा कवीनां गणनामस कनिष्ठिकाऽधिष्ठितकालिदासा ।
अद्यापि तत्तुल्यकवेरभावादनामिका साऽर्थवती बभूव ॥
&ldquo;While once enumerating the poets, the first finger was occupied by Kâlidása (as being the first). But the second finger remained true to its name (37/fq4=nameless ) as his second has not yet been found by whom it can be occupied.” Pandit Govardhanáchárya thus speaks of our poet-
साकूतमधुरकोमलविलासिनीकण्ठकूजितप्राये । शिक्षासमयेऽपि मुद्दे रतलीलाकालिवासोती ॥
&ldquo;Two things only viz, love-sport and Kálidása&rsquo;s poetry delight the heart even at the time of instruction as they consist of the sweet, tender and touching words of a sportive girl,&rdquo; Almost every Pandit has in his mouth the following memorable verse-
काव्येषु नाटकं रम्यं तभ रम्यं शकुन्तला ।
aufa a aguisgean winagey |||
&ldquo;Among poetic compositions the drama is most pleasant, and
among
dramas S&rsquo;âkuntala is the best. Even there the fourth act and especially four s&rsquo;lokas therein are most beautiful.” Every reader of the S&rsquo;ákuntala can easily find out for himself the four memorable S&rsquo;lokas referred to here. The highest place is assigned to Kalidára among posts for the construction of happy similes, when it is said-
They are—यास्यत्यद्य शकुन्तलेति &amp;c.; शुश्रूषण हरूतू. &amp;c.; अभिजनवतो भर्तुः साध्ये &amp;c.; and भूत्वा चिराग चतुरन्तमहीसपत्नी &amp;०.

Pandit Jayadeva speaks of our poet as aftgøye, &rsquo;the lorđ of poets&rsquo; and the fare &lsquo;sporting place&rsquo; of the damsel of poetry. Goethe, the celebrated post, philosopher and critic of Germany thus describes the poet in his well-known linest-
“Wouldst thou the young years, blossoms and fruits of its decline,
And all by which the soul is charmed, enraptured, feasted, fed;
Wouldst thou the earth and heaven itself in one sole name combine ?
I name thee, O S&rsquo;akuntalá! and all at once is said,&rdquo;
When we remember that Goethe himself was the greatest poet of Germany and one of the greatest of the world, we realize the importance of his estimate of our poet. The wellknown philosopher and traveller, Humboldt, pronounces the following judgment-&rdquo; Kálidase, the celebrated author of the S&rsquo;akuntala, is a masterly describer of the influence which nature exercises upon the minds of lovers; *** Tenderness in the expression of feeling and richness of creative fancy have assigned to him his lofty place among the posts of all nations&quot;. The celebrated critic Schlegel also has assigned him a very high position amongst the glorious company of the &lsquo;Sons of Song.&rsquo;
Several eminent Orientalists have also offered their tribute of praise to our Indian Shakespeare, as Sir Williams Jones was the first to call him-the very comparison of Kálidása to Shakespeare is the highest form of eulogy that could be bestowed upon him by foreign oritics, Sir M. Monier-Williams while writing about the S&rsquo;akuntala thus expresses himself &ldquo;No composition of Kálidasa displays more the richness of his poetical genius, the exuberance of his imagination, the warmth and play of his fancy, his profound knowledge of the human heart, his delicate appreciation of its most refined and tender emotions, his familiarity with the workings and counterworkings of its conflicting feelings-in short, more entitles him to rank as the Shakespeare of India.&rdquo; Prof, Lassen-we are sorry for want of space we cannot quote him fully-calis

him the brightest star in the firmament of Indian (artificial?) poetry. We thus find that Kálidása has established his sovereignty in the hearts of all alike. Now it may be asked * what is there in Kálidasa which establishes his undisputed claim to the highest honour which is thus bestowed upon him?&rsquo; Unless this question is answered satisfactorily, Kâlidâsa&rsquo;s merits as a poet cannot be said to be determined. We have discussed this question in the last section of our Introduction to the S&rsquo;akuntala to which the student is referred.
Now we shall briefly consider Kâlidâsa&rsquo;s poetry, his style and diction in general. His poetic genius has brought Sanskrit poetry to the highest elegance and refinement. His style is peculiarly pure and chaste, &lsquo;It has neither the laxity of the Puranas nor the extravagant colouring of later poems. It is unartificial and characterized by brevity consistent with perspicuity. An unaffected simplicity of expression and ar easy-flowing language mark his writings which are embellished with similes unparalleled for their beauty and appropriateness, and pithy general sayings. His diction is marked by absence of long compounds, involved constructions, and overwrought rhetoric, and by very few pune, Kálidása excels other poets in his description of the sublime and the beautiful. It is a principle recognized by all modern critics that Nature must be the life and essence of poetry;&rsquo; and in this respect Kalidasa may be said to be essentially a poet of Nature (of course in the limited sense of the term which it is possible to attach to it in those times of gay luxury and general prosperity). He describes with most effective touches the gorgeous scenery of the mountain Himalaya-ite snow-clad and mineral-covered summits, the peaks where snn-shine ever reigns, the fragrant and cool breezes blowing there, the wilds with the hunters, the musk-deer, the potent herbs shedding lustre at night, the chamara deer, the Mánasa lake &amp;c.; and his description of the Ganges and the peaceful hermitage life is very striking and life-like. His descriptive powers are great and some of the scones in the S&rsquo;ák., the Kumára., the Meg. and the Rag. are so enchanting as to hold his readers spell-bound.</p>

THE DATE OF THE POET.
We turn now to the much vexed question about the date of Kálidâsa and, thanks to the labours of Prof. R. N. Apte and Mr. Nandargikar, it may now be said to have been finally established. But we have neither the time nor space at our disposal even to fully quote their arguments on the point. We shall, therefore, give a brief summary of the main arguments on which they (and especially the former) have based their conclusions. Tradition mentions Kálidasa as a contemporary of king Vikramaditya, as one of the nine gems at his courtKing Vikramaditya, who was an epoch-maker, founded the era known after him, which is almost universally accepted as commencing from 56 B. O. A few antiquarians, however, do not accept this as the correct date of that monarch but bring him down to A. D. 544 propounding a theory of their own which is known as
544 A. D.
THE KORUR THEORY.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The battle of Korurf marks a turning point in Indian bis. tory, Vikramaditya having defeated in it the Mtechchhas. Mr. Fergusson held that to commemorate this important ovoat an era was invented and that its beginning was placed back six hundred years. So he supposed the true date of Vikramaditya to be A. D. 544; and this theory for a time held away; for a long time after the researches of scholars had commenced in the field of ancient Indian chronology, no inscription was discoverred bearing a date prior to 600 of the Vikrama era. Such an inscription, however, has been lately discovered,‡ viz. the Mandasor Inscription, dated the year 494 of the Vikrama era. Its great support being thus taken away the Korur Theory collapses and the time-honoured authority of the traditionary account remains unshaken. Then there is</p>

<li>Kalidasa was once unscrupulously dragged down to the 11th century A. D. by some Western scholars. But the discovery of the Aikole inscription (which is dated 634 A, D.) at once furnished the 7th century A. D. as the downward limit of the poet&rsquo;s date.

THE THEORY OF THE NINE GEMS.
धन्वन्तरिक्षपणकामरसिंहश कुबेताल भइघटकर्पर कालिदासाः । ख्यातो वराहमिहिरो नृपतेः समार्था रत्नानि वे वररुचिर्नव विक्रमस्थ ॥
Nine eminent men called &rsquo;the nine gems&rsquo; adorned the Court of Vikramaditya. Of these Amaradeva or Amarasimha is said to have lived between the visits to this country of Fa Hlan and Hiouen Thsang in 414 A. D. and 642 A. D. respectively. For in Fa Hian&rsquo;s time the great shrine at Gaya, which an inscription says was built by Amaradeva, was not in existence, while it has been referred to in the account of the second Chinese pilgrim. Varáhamihira is supposed to have died in 587. On the evidence of these contemporaries of the poet, Dr. Kern, who is a strong supporter of this theory, places Kâlidása in the latter half of the sixth century. Next there is THE THEORY OF RENAISSANCE
era
Propounded by Dr. Max Muller. He divides the whole Sanskrit literary period into two parts, the first beginning with the Vedas and ending with the first century of the Christian Then comes what the great Doctor calls &lsquo;an interregmnm’– a period during which foreigners invaded India and so the literary genius was dormant. Dr. Max Muller places the Renaissance of Sanskṛt learning in the 6th century A, D, with the reign of Vikramaditya. The period called &lsquo;Interregnum&rsquo; was really speaking not destitute of literary productivity, as has been shown by Drs. Peterson and G. Bühler and therefore, if Kalidasa is to be considered as the first post of the new school, he must be placed considerably earlier than Dr. Max Muller does. This theory is also weakened by the fall of the Korur theory. Thus these two theories cannot be regarded as perfectly sound, whereas the theory of the nine gems is but imperfectly put forth, and not without many a priori conolusions and speculations as to probabilities. If the tradition about the nine gems proves anything, beyond doubt it proves the connection of Kâlidâsa with king Vikramaditya, being corroborated by other kind of evidence, such as the covert allusions to that king in the Vik. &amp;c. As for the contemporaneity of the nine gems the tradition cannot be true.
There are some minor things which have been pushed into the controversy. These are the alleged covert references to Dinnaga</li>
<li>For some of the anecdotes referring to Kâlidàss in connection with this point see our Intro, to Raghu. p. 11.(9)
and Nichula in the Meghadúta, the former a foe and the latter a friend of Kâlidása, the identity of Matṛgupta, a king of Kashmir, and Kâlidûsa ( for, names in Sanskrit are often titles and Mátrigupta, lit. &rsquo; protected by the mother&rsquo; may also be taken as Káligupta or Kálidása) and the supposed astronomical references in the works of Kâlidása to the astronomical theories of A&rsquo;ryabhata who lived in 479 A, D. Prof. Apte has examined all these at some length and on the first point he comes to the conclusion that Dinnaga and Nichula were not contemporaries of the great Kálidása, but must have been contemporaries of some other Kálidása. On the second point he observes that Måtṛgupta and Kálidása were two different persons, since they are differently quoted by Kshemedra and other writers and commentators (and among them by Raghavabhatta), The supposed astronomical references* have really no astronomical significance at all and it cannot be said that Kálidasa was acquainted with the astronomical works of A&rsquo;ryabhaṭa. Mr. K. B. Pathak, the latest exponent of the 6th century theory repeats the arguments given above but principally grounds his conclusion on his theory about the Húna kings, allusion to whom is made by the poet in the Raghuvams&rsquo;s. He argues that since there is no mention made of the Húņas in the Ramayana, the conclusion follows that Kalidasa unconsciously refers to the Húna kings of his own time who held sway over the Punjab and Kashmir, and especially to Mihiracula who, about the year 532-533 retired to the Punjab after his overthrow by Yas&rsquo;odharman and Bálâditya, But this rests merely on assumption; for there are references to the Hu&rsquo;nas even in Mah. Bha&rsquo;r.-Prof. Apte has also shown that just beyond Bactria or the threshold of ancient India, the Hipas had instituted a powerful empire from the middle of the 3rd century B. C, the end of the 1st or the 2nd century A. D.
to
Vatsabhu&rsquo;ti, the author of the Mandasor inscription, copies several ideas from Kâlidâsa; the latter must, therefore, have lived prior to 473 A, D. Again As&rsquo;vaghosha, the author of a life of the great Bhuddha in Sanskrit, has numerous pa-</li>

XIV. 40) where art is wrongly translated as &rsquo;the shadow of the earth&rsquo;, its correct significance being &rsquo; a reflection&rsquo; as clearly interpreted by Malli. The word art is similarly used in S&rsquo;ak. VII.32.
(10)
ssages similar to those occurring in the works of Kálidása. Now Kálidása was an original poet borrowing his subjects from Valmiki and other ancient authors. A&rsquo;svaghosha was more of a philosopher than a poet and may with greater probability be supposed to have borrowed his ideas from Kálidâsa. The date of A&rsquo;svaghosha is given as 78 A, D., and if we suppose him to have borrowed from Kâlidása, the latter will have to be placed earlier than 78 A. D. And in this view Dr. Peterson also concurs when he says &ldquo;Kálidása stands near the beginning of the Christian era, if, indeed, he does not overtop it.&rdquo;
There is also internal evidence pointing to the same conclusion. We have first the evidence obtained from the state of the law of inheritance and the penalty for theft as they are indicated in passages in the S ́ák. The passage in the sixth Act of the drama anouncing the death of the merchant Dhanamitra who was dying heirless, seems to Prof. Apte to refer to a period when the widow of a deceased person could not inherit his estate. Such a period is to be found only before the Christian era, when Manu, A&rsquo;pastamba and Vasishtha held away, and Bṛhaspati, S&rsquo;ankha, Likhits and Yájñavalkya had not yet written their codes. The penalty for theft as indicated in the prologue to the sixth Act seems to have been the extreme one, it being the theft of a jewel. There is also a passage of similar import in the Vik. (ì quigaf &amp;c. V. 1.) in which the feathery thief that had stolen away the king&rsquo;s favourite gem is referred to. The penalty for theft has been from time to time mitigated with the progress of civilization, Manu and A&rsquo;pastamba lay down the extreme penalty, the option of fine being introduced later on as we find it in the Smṛti of Brhaspati. These two circumstances tend to show that Kálidâsa flourished at a period which is anterior to Bṛhaspati, the latter being generally placed in the first century A. D.
Prof. Apte further calls attention to the fact there is no reference to the Nyáya philosophy in the works of Kálidasa, except perhaps in Rag. XIII. 1, in which the word so (..) occurs but which the poet might have borrowed from the Sankhya philosophy and concludes that he must have. lived before the development of that philosophy. Then again we have the evidence of style. The artificiality of diction and fondness for long compounds and double-meaning words which
( 11 )
mark the writings of Dandin (who in his Kávyádars&rsquo;a says that an abundance of compounds forms the very life of poetry), Bápa, Bbavabhú&rsquo;ti (7th century A. D.) and other medieval writers, are entirely absent in Kálidâsa, a fact which shows that he must be placed some six or seven centuries before them-a period necessary to cause such a revolution in the art of literary composition considering the scanty means of the propagation of learning in those times. From the above-mentioned fow facts it is abundantly clear that Kalidasa lived in the 1st century B. O, at the latest (the upward limit of his date being 300 B. C. according to some writers ).
Some modern scholars, however, have adopted the view that Kalidea must have flourished under one or more of the Gupta kings. The Gupta period (about 300-650 A ̧D.) was notable in the ancient history of India for a revival of Sanskrit learning and arts. Mr. Vincent A. Smith in his
The Early History of India&quot; (3rd ed., 1914) believes that Kalidasa must have flourished in the reigns of one or more of these Gupta kings:-
Chandragupta II. (O. 357-413) Kumaragupta I. (413-455)
Skandagupta ( 455-480)
Both Chandragupta II. and Skandagupta had adopted the title Vikramaditya.
Mr. Smith says:-&quot; It is not unlikely that the earliest works of Kâlidasa, namely, the Ritusamhŝra ( if that be his ), and the Meghadúta, may have been composed before A. D. 418, that is to say, while Chandragupta II. was on the throne, but I am inclined to regard the reign of Kumâragupta I. (413-455) as the time during which the poet&rsquo;s later works were composed, and it seems possible, or even probable, that the whole of his literary career fell within the limits of that reign. It is also possible that he may have continued writing after the accession of Skandagupta.&quot; Mr. Smith thus makes Kalidasa&rsquo;s literary career extend over a period of not less than thirty years. There is thus nothing wrong in the tradition about Vikramâditya being our poet&rsquo;s patron, only we must arrive at an understanding as to which Vikramaditya is referred to.

II.
THE POEM.
The Kamarasambhava or the poem descriptive of the birth of Kumára &quot; is a Mahákávya. It is is a Sravya Kavya or poetry to be chanted and heard and is a metrical composition. Besides the Mahákávyas, S&rsquo;ravya Ka&rsquo;vya includes:-( 1 ) Khandakavyas, such as the Megbadûta, which are also metrical (2) Vrittagandbi, Kathâ and A&rsquo;khyayikê, which are all composed in prose; and (3) Champus &amp;o, which are mixed.
A Mahâkávya ought to consist of cantos not less than eight and more than thirty in number, and not containing less than thirty and more than two hundred s’lokas each.* It may be concerned with the description of the life of a single hero like the S&rsquo;is&rsquo;upa&rsquo;lavadha or the Vikrama&rsquo;nkadevacharita, or of Kartikeya, the hero of the present poem. If there be one hero he must be either a celestial character as in the present case or a Kshatriya of noble descent and possessed of the qualities of a Dhírodâtta Náyaka †, and if more than one, they must all be good Kshatriyas sprung from the same racet. Every canto must have a uniform metre which is allowed to change only at the close, though there may occasionally be a canto containing a variety of metres§, such as Kir. V. or S&rsquo;is&rsquo;. IV. At the end of each canto there should be a reference to the subject of the next succeeding canto. The predominant senti. ment should be either Sṛngåra or Vira or S&rsquo;a&rsquo;nta, i. e., the sentiment of Love, or of Heroism, or Tranquillity. ¶

The object of such compositions should be the attainment of the four objects of human desire (i. e. they should be written in such a way that their perusal would point out the means of attaining these ); iz, धर्म, अर्थ, काम and मोक्ष. A Maháka vya must, as well, contain a description of great cities, oceans, mountains, seasons, the rise of the sun and the moon, sporting with ladies in gardens and water, carousings, separations and unions of lovers &amp;c. &amp;c. The style should be embellished with rhetorical ornament and be fully sentimental *. Nothing that violates the dignity of Kavya or poetry, such as unmeaning talk &amp;c. should be introduced in a Mahákávya. &lsquo;If a poem be written with due attention to these canons,
remarks Dandín, it will endure to the end of a Kalpa.&rsquo;
?
蓄
The Kuma&rsquo;rasambhava has all the
requirements of
a Mahákávya and is classed as such by Sanskritists. The available recension of the Kâvya consists of 17 cantos or Sargas though some believe that it has twenty-two in all. It has a commentary by Mallinâtha upto eight cantos only. It is now generally believed that only these eight are the work of the poet, the rest were written either by some later writer or by some disciple of Kálidasa. The commentator Râmagovinda states that the Kumarasambhava extends to eight cantos only. Again it may be remarked that the title &ldquo;The Birth of Kumâra&rdquo; cannot very well apply to the whole of the poem. The eighth canto properly leads up to the (not actual but potential) of the War-God, and the poem may naturally end there. If the poet goes on describing the war against the demon Taraka in Heaven, as is done in the succeeding cantos, it would be inconsistent with the scope and plan of the poem as suggested by its title. If the defeat and the death of Târaka were to be the subject-matter, it should have been called by some other name, such as artmay. Again the evidence of style conclusively proves that cantos 9-17 are certainly not written by the author of the first eight.

Such is not the opinion of Dr. Ryder, however. He accepts the later cantos as genuine on what seem to us to be trifling and inconclusive arguments. The learned Doctor argues, for instance, that the last nine cantos are worse poetry than the first eight, because love, and not fighting, was Kalidasa&rsquo;s forte. Does Dr. Ryder forget the spirited fighting scenes in the Raghuvams&rsquo;a ?
The hero of this poem is a divine being and one of the Dhirodátta class. The prevailing sentiment, as far as the first eight cantos are concerned, is Sṛngâra, Karuņa and S&rsquo;ânta, though not very prominent, being accessories to it. The 3rd and oth cantos are a good illustration of Vipralambha, the 4th that of Karuna, and the 7th of Viváha. The subject of each following canto is hinted at the end of the preceding one. The description of cities, seasons &amp;c. can be easily marked, It must, however, be remarked here that the poet, in his zeal to describe a lover just married, has spoiled the character of E&rsquo;iva, which he had well maintained in the first six cantos.
THE STORY.
(CANTOS I-VIII.)
Satí, the daughter of Daksha and once the wife of S&rsquo;iva, was born as the daughter of the mountain Himalaya and Mená and was sent, on attaining youth, at Nárada&rsquo;s advice to attend upon S&rsquo;iva who, ever since he was bereft of his wife, had been practising penance on one of the Himalayan peaks. In the meanwhile the gods, who were harassed by the demon Táraka, invincible in his might by a boon from God Brahmâ, went, with Indra at their head, to the self-existing God, Brahmá, for counsel. The gods propitiated him with appropriate prayers and he discovered himself to them, and suggested them a way to remove Táraks, their powerful enemy. The only hero to lead the host of Heaven against him and to destroy him was the son of the Dark-necked God, S&rsquo;iva; so it was ordained. And the gods were told to induce the Trident-holder to take Una to wife. Indra, the leader of the gods, thought of Káma and the Mind-born presented himself before his master for orders. (Cantos I. II.)
The boasting deity was entrusted with the mission of shaking the self-restraint of S&rsquo;iva, who had been practising austeri-
(15)
ties on the snow-clad peaks of the Himalaya, ever since the self-immolation of Sati. The god of the flowery bow started on the mission, accompanied by his faithful consort Rati and his comrade Vasanta. He appeared on the peaks of the Himalaya, and all of a sudden trees and plants put out fresh sprouts, the earth became clad untimely with vernal glory, the beast of the forest and the fowl of the air showed the influence of Káma; and even the anchorites found it hard to control their senses. Káma found an unconscious weapon in Umâ who was there, with the permission of her father, to attend upon God S&rsquo;iva, whom she secretly loved and wanted to marry. The God of love succeeded in disturbing the peace of mind of S&rsquo;iva for a moment only. But the fire of anger fiashed through his third eye on discovering the cause of his disturbance and burnt Káma even as he was preparing to strike him. S&rsquo;iva then vanished from sight, and Párvatí, discomfited at heart, returned home with her two companions. Ratî, on seeing her consort turned into a mere heap of grey ashes, lamented over the sad loss, and called upon Vasanta to arrange a funeral pyre, on which she declared her intention of burning herself. The preparations were being made when suddenly a voice in the air commanded them to desist, as Rati would be united once more with Káma as soon as the Trident-holder would lead Umá to the altar. (Cantos III, IV.)
Párvatî, sorely disappointed, cursed her unmatched beauty and seeing no other way to gain her object resolved to practise penance and, permitted by her father, resorted to a forest for that purpose, though much against the wishes of her mother. There she continued mortifying the flesh by all the known processes and was not daunted by the severest tests of penance, ever undergone by the ascetics. S&rsquo;iva at last relented and came to the penance-forest, disguised as a Sanyásin, to test the strength of Umá&rsquo;s attachment. He found fault with the great God, called him bad names, laughed at his poverty and declared him altogether unworthy of her hand and of any heroic attempts at austerities to that end, till at last Umâ could bear it no longer, and in great anger desired her maid to turn him out. Then did the great God discover himself to her and declared that he was thenceforward entirely at her disposal being won over by her penance. Párvatî requested him formally to apply to her father for her which he consented to do. The great
(16)
God then mentally summoned the seven sages to his presence and, on their presenting themselves before him with due respect, he asked them to go to Himálaya and request him on his behalf to bestow his daughter in marriage on him. The sages praised Siva in suitable terms and started on their mission. In a short space of time they reached Oshadhiprastha, the capital of Himalaya, the beauty of which they much admired and descended into the palace of the Mountain, Himalaya received them with proper respect and veneration and after praises had been mutually bestowed-by the Mountain upon the sages and by the sages upon the mountain-asked them in courteous terms the purpose of their visit. That they told him and the Mountain showed his delight by asking his daughter to salute the sages as S&rsquo;iva&rsquo;s bride. They then fixed the date of the marriage for the fourth day from that day, returned to S&rsquo;iva, informed him of the success of their mission and, permitted by him, went back to their celestial abode. (Cantos V, VI.).
Himalaya made great preparations for the coming marriage in which the townsmen also took an active part. The city was splendidly decorated and when the auspicious time came the bride was made to bathe and the marriage decorations were put on her, an arrow being placed in her hand as enjoinded in the case of a Kshatriya maiden. The bride-groom&rsquo;s party, formed of all the principal divinities, arrived in due season and was received in great pomp by the bride&rsquo;s party. The ladies of the town greatly admired the bride and the bridegroom and praised Brahms for having united two persons so worthy of each other. The marriage was concluded at the auspicious hour, all the rites attendant upon a Hindu marriage being duly performed. The newly married couple then saluted Brahmâ who pronounced a blessing upon it. The goddess Sarasvati also blessed the two. After the conclusion of the marriage the guests dispersed, while S&rsquo;iva lived at the house of the bride. The first month after marriage was spent by S&rsquo;iva and Párvatî in the palace of Himalaya in Oshadhiprasttha. After that the happy couple wandered through varions mountain tracts until once at sunset they reached the summit of the mountain Gandhamádana, where, seated on a stone-slab, S&rsquo;iva described the sunset to Párvati. There they drank wine brought to them by the guardian deity of the Gandhamâdana grove. S&rsquo;iva, with Párvatî, then entered a house of precious stones
(17)
furnished with all luxuries, called into existence by his mental power and passed twenty five years there enjoying the happy company of his wife. (Cantos VII-VIII. ).
CRITICISM.
In the Kumarasambhava Kalidasa chooses a higher plane for the play of his genius. In the Raghuvams&rsquo;a his heroes are mon; in the Meghadûta the story refers to the Yakshas who occupy in their semi-divine nature a position midway between men and gods. In the Birth of Kumara&rsquo; the post deals solely with gods and beings of another world, though in doing so he does not fail to invest them with human sentiments, without which, indeed, the poem would have lost most of its charm. The scene is laid among the valleys and on the slopes of the Himalaya, a mountain which is, as we are told in the very first verse, art; and all subsequent actions that take place there are divine and superhuman. Then follows a description of qraft and this is done so skilfully that the master-hand for a while makes us forget that we are reading about a goddess and not about a woman on earth&rsquo;. The scene of the second canto is laid in Brahmaloka and here, as in the tenth canto of the Raghuvams&rsquo;a, Kâlidâsu shows his intimate knowlege of the leading ideas of Hindu philosophy. The third canto gives him an opportunity for a description of spring and he has wonderfully succeeded in drawing a picture true to Nature and at the same time of an unsurpassed poetic beauty. Very few descriptions in other poets would compare with this in the Kumára beginning with कुबेरगुप्तां दिशमुष्णरश्मी गन्तुं प्रवृत्ते समयं विलङ्कय । दिग्दक्षिणा गन्धवहं मुखेन व्यलीकनिःश्वासमिवोत्ससर्ज ॥ (III. 25). The fourth canto shows Kâlidása to be a master of Karuḥarasa, and the lament of Rati is so splendid that some timorous rhetoricians have considered that the excess and recurrence of emotion has become a fault (conỡ ật: 1 पुनः पुनर्दीप्तिः । यथा कुमारसंभवे रतिविलापे । ). The student will find that this lament has its counterpart in the far of the 8th canto of the Raghuvams&rsquo;a. In the fifth canto q is

described in the rôle of a tapasvinî her, disguised as a Brahmachárin. Their dialogue is one of the best-known passages in Kàlidâsa&rsquo;s works, where his powers of repartee, humour and piquancy of style are seen at their best. The sixth canto is rather a tame one, only enlivened by the fine
( 18 )
description of ओषधिप्रस्थ, the capital city of Himá laya. The seventh canto is devoted to a very detailed description of the marriage-ceremany and the processions, and he has given it a human touch again by the prevailing tone of domesticity throughout. The eight and the last canto is considered by many to be a crowning achievement of Kálidása&rsquo;s poetical skill, and the quotations from this canto occurring in standard critical works like काव्यालंकारसूत्र, सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण and others are more numerous than from any other canto. Indeed, it may be said without exaggeration that in the descriptions of the sunset, twilight and nightfall on the mountain, Kalidasa has excelled himself; they abound with the finest similes and the grandest imagery.
It is difficult to judge, owing to its shortness, whether the Kumarasambhava is as great a poetic triumph as the Raghurams&rsquo;a; in this difficulty itself lies, wo think, the evidence of the greatness of Kálidasa&rsquo;s genius. Dr. Ryder rightly prefers the Raghuvamsá, but is constrained to remark that &ldquo;there are passages in The Birth of the War-God of a piercing beauty which the world can never let die. &quot;</li>

<p>The story of the poem closely follows the one given in S&rsquo;ivapurána, and Kâlidâsa seems to have drawn considerably upon the original both in point of facts and language. In a few places he follows the Brahma-Purána and the KálikâPurana. We subjoin the following extracts from the S&rsquo;. P. which will not only throw light on some of the incidents mentioned in the poem, but enable the student to see how far Kali, has improved upon the original.</p>

It is more probable, however, that this part of the S&rsquo;iva P. is a mere version of the Kum, by some meddle some plagiarist unscrupulously inserted in the Purana. A great poet like Kálidasa is not likely to borrow either the exact language or the ideas of such Puránas.(29)
MALLINATHA.*
We cannot close this brief preface without referring to Mallinátha, the well-known commentator of the five Mahākâvyas and the Meghadûta. While writing about the poet we had to remark that he says absolutely nothing about himself in his writings and the same may almost be said of his great scholiast Malli. The late Pandit Durga&rsquo;prasada says in his introduction to the S&rsquo;is&rsquo;upálavadha that he was a Bra&rsquo;hmaņa of the Vatsagotra and a native of Tribhuvanagiri, in the district of Kadappa, in Telangana (Andhrades&rsquo;a ). He seems to have helieved that he is the same as Mallinátha, the father of Nara - bari, otherwise called Saraswatitirtha, the auther of Balachittanurangini, a commentary on the Káv. Pra, Pandit Vámanacharya in his Kâv. Pra. emphatically asserts that he is not to be confounded with Mallinâtha referred to above and says that he was a Brahmana of the Kâs&rsquo;yapa gotra and that his descendants are still living at Gajendragada in the Dhârawâd district.
HIS DATE-(The first quarter of the 14th century). “Malli. quotes Bopa Deva in one of his commentaries. Bopa Deva was one of Hemádri&rsquo;s protagees; and Ilemádri was a minister of Mahâdeva and Rámchandra, the Yádava kings of Devagiri who reigned from 1260 A. D. to 1309. A. D. Bopa Deva must have taken sometime to establish his reputation as author. Under these circumstances Mallinátha must have lived after the 13th century. (See Prof. Aufrecht&rsquo;s Oxford Cat. No. 218).&rdquo; Mr. S. G. Deshpande. (Ths latter half of the 14th century Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar has shown in his Mâl. Måd. (Preface pp.
XIX. XX) that Malli. lived before Jagaddhara, the commentator of the Málati Madhava, the Venisambara, and the Vasavadattá, since the latter alludes to him in his com on the Mâl. Mád. ( Dr. Bhâṇḍârkar&rsquo;s Ed. P. 286 ). In the Introduction to his vocabulary the author of the Medini mentions Madhava. If this Madhava is the same as the great minister of Bukka and Harihara, Medini must have been written after the 3rd quarter of the fourteenth century. Rayamukata, in his com. on Amarakos&rsquo;a quotes the Medini and Ráyamukuts, as he himself tells us, wrote his com. in 1383 Sâka or 1431 A. D. The author of the Medini therefore lived between
*

( 30 )
1375 and 1431 A. D. (Dr. Bhâṇḍârkar&rsquo;s Preface to Mál. p. XXI). And since Mallinâtha never quotes the lexicon Medini in his vast commentories the conclusion follows that the lexicon was not in existence then, and that Mallinátha is a predecessor of the Medinikára. He therefore lived in the latter part of
the 14th century.
Mallinâtha is a commentator of great merit and literary acumen. He has written commentaries as stated above on the principle five Kávyas, the Bhattikávya, the Ekavali, a on poetics (published in the Bombay Sanskrit Series) and (according to Mr. Deshpande) on the Kavyadars&rsquo;a of Dandin. He might have written commentaries on other works also. He was a profound grammarian, well versed in the Nyaya and Vais eshika philosophies and thoroughly acqainted with the Pauráṇic and Tantra literature, as he himself tells us in his indroductory slokas* to the Rag.; and the extreme popularity of his commentaries shows that this was not an idle boast. His commentaries are preeminently adopted to the wants of the general reader. They are sufficiently expressive without being prolix. He never makes a vain display of his knowledge but strictly follows the method once laid down by himself viz. q¿ लिख्यते किंचिन्नानपेक्षितमुच्यते । He is perhaps the only commentator on the poems of Kálidasa who shows great appreciation of poetry and endeavours to preserve, as far as possible, the genuine readings of the poets studiously rejecting the spurious substitutions either of single words or phrases, and the occasional interpolations of whole stanzas. He has called his commentary on each of the three poems of Kâlidâsa the Sanjivanî or what reinspires with life &ldquo;the Speech of Kálidåsa that lay in a trance under the effect of the poison of bad commentaries.&rdquo; He modestly expressest his inability to grasp the real pith of Kálidasa&rsquo;s poetry but he says that he would follow in the footsteps of Dakshiņāvarta and Nátha, two old commentators, whose commentaries were supposed to have been lost till recently, when they were discovered in South India. From what we have seen of them they are not undeserving of the praise bestowed upon them by Mallinâtha.

<h2 id="preface">PREFACE.</h2>
<p>In revising the 2nd edition of the Kumarasambhava { Cantos I-VII) special attention was given to the wants of the students of the different Indian Universities. The translation is so rendered as to explain the text intelligibly. The prose order of each sl, has been given in the com. by using bold type; the compound words uot actually given by Malli. being enclosed in rectangular brackets. The notes which have been considerably increased explain all allusions, all grammatical points not touched by Malli, &amp;c. &amp;c. To enable the students to grasp the whole story at once the contents of all the eight cantos have been main out-line of the original story, as given in the S&rsquo;iva Purána, has also been given in original Sanskrit. Before concluding I thankfully acknowledge the help derived from Mr. Deshpande&rsquo;s edition, to which I am also indebted for a few quotations from the Purâņas, especially from the S&rsquo;iva Purana, I have also to thank S&rsquo;rish Chandra Chakravarti B. A., whose edition of the text was useful to me in solving some points of grammar.
