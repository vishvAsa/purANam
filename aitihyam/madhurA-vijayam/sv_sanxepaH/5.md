Establishing himself by and by there in Marakata,  
a magnificent metropolis adorning Mother Earth,  
the King governed the whole land,  
challenged by none,  
bringing peace to his subjects.

At the threshold to the Prince’s palace,  
the jewelled dust billowing forth  
every day  
as kings jostled,  
bracelet brushing against bracelet,  
dried up the slush created by the springs of ichor  
streaming from war elephants.

It was then that Grīṣma came,  
leading the King to revel in  
breaths of air chill and fragrant from fans,  
doe-eyed women smeared with sandalwood,  
nights aglint with the moon.

Forcibly parted from his sweetheart the South  
by destiny’s decree,  
and longing to allay his love-burn,  
as it were,  
day after day   
the hot-rayed sun  
steered a steady course  
for the Himālaya-cooled North.[^1]

The formidable elephant that was the flower-arrowed Kāma,  
scorched by the summer heat  
found relief upon the slopes of beautiful women’s breasts,  
home to refreshing sandal  
and entrancing rivulets  
trickling down in pearl-string triplets.

Every day  
the waters of the palaces’ lakes  
shrank a little further away  
beaten into terror by the sloping breasts  
of the ladies of that land  
larking about lithely as they bathed.

Then came the coming of the rains,  
impersonating the King:  
*camara* 
fly-whisks in the *nicula* blossom  
into clusters bursting;  
suppliants in the *cātaka* birds,  
words of praise ever singing.[^2]

[^2]: The association, seen throughout this canto, of certain flora and fauna with each season follows poetic convention.[^4]: After dancing and singing all monsoon, peacocks fall silent in Śarad.[^6]: Separated from their lovers, travellers suffer keenly the effects of Kāma in Vasanta.

Flinging the sacred ash of *ketakī* pollen

the clouds exorcised the spirit of spite  
possessing the King’s young wives.
